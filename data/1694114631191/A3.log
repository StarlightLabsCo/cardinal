[1694114675883] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Plan: [39m Will's plan for the next few days would revolve around acclimating himself to the mining environment. He aims to understand the labyrinthine routes of the mine, remember to put on his helmet at all times, and manage his tools better so as to not break any more pickaxes. He also plans on spending more time with George and Thomas, absorbing their experiences and stories to bolster his own understanding of mining. Most importantly, every strike of his pickaxe brings him one step closer to his dream of discovering a rare gem in the heart of the mine.
