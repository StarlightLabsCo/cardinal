[1691126985751]Plan: 
[1691126985751]1. Move to the mine site, as it is the highest priority task.
2. Mine ore at the mine site.
3. Return to the village and store extra materials in the chest.
4. Move to the lumberyard.
5. Chop trees at the lumberyard.
6. Return to the village and secure the area.

Rationale: The tasks are prioritized and the plan aligns with the priority sequence. Despite having an inventory with a few items, picking up any other items is not necessary for any of the priority tasks. Therefore, there isn't a need to drop any items. 

Selected Action:
Use the "functions.MoveTo" action to move to the mine site at 51, 17.

[1691127007444]Plan: 
[1691127007444]Based on the priorities attached to the tasks I've noted three distinct phases. 

Phase 1:
-Move to the mine site at 51, 17 (task priority 1)
-Mine for ore (task priority 2)

Phase 2:
-Return to the village location at 2, -58 (task priority 3)
-Store extra materials in the chest (presumably these are the mined ores) (task priority 3)

Phase 3:
-Move to the lumberyard at 72, -55.1 (task priority 4)
-Chop trees at the lumberyard (task priority 5)

Throughout or at the end of these phases:
-Secure the village (task priority 6), which seems to be a standing task or a task that needs to be performed intermittently in between other tasks.

Given my current location (5.7, -57.9) the closest location according to the tasks is the mining site at 51, 17. So the first action to be undertaken is to move to that location. 

Action:
Use MoveTo function with the following parameters:
{
characterId: 'A1',
x: 51,
y: 17
}

[1691127026238]Plan: 
[1691127026238]1. Given that Thomas's current task with highest priority is to "Move to mine site at 51, 17".
2. Execute the MoveTo function to reach the mine site.
3. Once at the mine site, Thomas can mine for ore as per his task list. 
4. Thomas should then return to the village at location 2, -58 to store any extra materials in the chest.
5. Next, he should move to the lumberyard at location 72, -55.1 to chop trees.
6. After completing all these tasks, he needs to return to the village and secure the area as per his last task.
   
Available Action to take now:

Based on the plan and the current priority, the best action would be to move to the mine site at 51, 17 to start mining ore. We will use the MoveTo function with the correct parameters for this task as shown below:

functions.MoveTo({ characterId: "A1", x: 51, y: 17 })

[1691127041530]Plan: 
[1691127041530]1) Based on the priorities, Thomas should first move to the mining site at coordinates 51, 17. 
2) After reaching the mining site, he will mine ore.
3) Next, he will then return to the village located at 2, -58 and store the mined materials.
4) He will then proceed to the lumberyard located at 72, -55.1.
5) After reaching the lumberyard, he will chop trees.
6) His final task will then be to return to the village and secure the area.

Conclusion: 
Since our character Thomas is located at 5.7, -57.9 and has the task to reach the mining site at 51, 17 with priority 1, he should start moving towards the mining site.

Use function functions.MoveTo:

[1691127071174]Plan: 
[1691127071175]1. The first task on the list is to move to the mine site at 51, 17. Thus, our first step should be to complete this task and move to the given coordinates.
2. Once at the mine, complete the second task which is to mine for ore. Depending on the tools available, the character will start mining.
3. After we collect the ores from the mine, the third task directs us back to the village to store the extra materials in a chest. Hence, our character will move back to the village at 2, -58.
4. Next, the fourth task will include moving to the lumberyard at 72, -55.1, which will be our second location to move.
5. After reaching the lumberyard, the fifth task is to chop trees. Assuming that the character has an axe in his inventory, he will start chopping the trees.
6. The last task on the list is to return to the village and secure the area. This means moving back to the village once more and making sure everything is safe and secure.

Given all the tasks, our plan will include a lot of moving to different locations and using the tools available in our inventory (pickaxe for mining and an axe for chopping trees).

Action:

I will execute the first step in our plan, which is to move to the mine site at 51, 17.
