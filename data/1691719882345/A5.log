[1691719969369] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 Plan: [39m To embark on an exploration journey in the local woods, aiming to uncover more about nature's tales as told by George. My route will take me deep into the forest, possibly to the secret clearing I discovered previously. I also plan to expand my knowledge of the trees as Lucy once advised. After the exploration, I intend to return home safely, guided by the stars as I did once when I was lost.
[1691719979311] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 Say: [39mHey, Mr. Smith! I'm planning to go on an exploration in the local woods today. I want to learn more about the stories that George tells about the place. I've got this route planned out that will take me deep into the forest, probably up to that secret clearing I found once. And don't worry, I'm going to take care and if I ever get lost, I'll find my way back home by the stars, just like last time.

[1691720006572] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 Feel: [39mI feel excited by the adventure ahead, but also understand the responsibility in Mr. Smith's words and appreciate his concern for my safety.
[1691720017293] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 Explain: [39mI'm really excited about this new adventure in the woods. I've listened well to Mr. Smith's concerns and I understand that I have to be careful - the forest can be unpredictable and I need to be ready for anything. I have to pack enough supplies, let someone else know where I'm going beforehand, and avoid getting lost. I think the warning about returning before dark is especially important. I believe I'm making progress toward my goal of becoming a more experienced explorer, even if there's a lot to learn!
[1691720018633] [35m[CORTEX] Did I make progress? [39m[choice=yes]
[1691720020204] [35m[CORTEX] Did I accomplish my goal? [39m[choice=yes]
[1691720024524] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 Goodbye: [39mThank you, Mr. Smith, for your advice and concern. I'll make sure to pack enough supplies, check-in regularly and not take unnecessary risks. I'll also aim to return before dark. Wish me safe and  exciting exploration!
