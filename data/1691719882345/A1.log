[1691719986651] [36m[CORTEX] Character 2 Plan: [39mTo give Eli some safety advice before he sets out on his exploration in the forest, and ensure he has the necessary precautions in place.
[1691720004480] [36m[CORTEX] Character 2 Say: [39mEli, I admire your courage and I understand your curiosity about the forest. It's important to know the land we live on. But remember that the forest can be unpredictable, and I want you to be safe. Be sure to pack enough supplies and always let someone else know where you're going beforehand. Check in regularly. And of course, make sure you won't get lost - the stars can guide you, but a compass can be a more reliable tool. Return before dark and don't take unnecessary risks. Happy exploring!
