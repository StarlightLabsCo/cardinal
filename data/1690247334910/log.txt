Given the available information, update your task list, and pick the best available action to accomplish the highest priority task. Respond in JSON: { type: [ActionType], data: {characterId optional parameters}}. Please note that if an action is in the available items list, you can execute it immediately, without needing to change or move. First you should list your reasoning and create a plan, and then using that plan, select an action and create a JSON object for that action with the necessary info. The JSON object must be immediately after "Action: " as we're using regex to parse it.

Plan: 
The highest priority task is to chop wood. For that, the lumberjack needs to move to a tree's location. He currently sees five trees in his memories, but they do not have associated distances. However, we also have a detailed list of trees with their coordinates and distances from Thomas. Therefore, we will choose the closest tree from this list. The tree at the coordinates X: 0.86, Y: -0.9 is the closest one with a distance of 1.244829m. 

To accomplish chopping wood, Thomas needs to move to the tree's location.

Once he is at the tree's location, he could use the axe in his inventory to begin chopping down the tree. This task step, however, seems to not be an immediately available action based on the provided list of 'Available Actions', therefore it might be triggered as a default behavior of the game when such an object and item scenario are combined, or it might be a following task to activate once the moving has been done. 

Action: { "type": "MoveTo", "data": { "characterId": "A1", "x": 0.86, "y": -0.9 }}

Plan: 
The first task is to 'Chop Wood'. Looking at the recent actions and environment data, Thomas is already next to a tree (Health: 5/10). He has already started chopping that particular tree and should continue until that tree is felled.

Reasoning:

1. Thomas has an Axe in his inventory.
2. Thomas' task is chopping wood.
3. Thomas is already at the location next to a tree.
4. He started chopping the tree already, so he needs to continue that.

So, in conclusion, the first step is to continue chopping the current tree.

Given the available information, update your task list, and pick the best available action to accomplish the highest priority task. Respond in JSON: { type: [ActionType], data: {characterId optional parameters}}. Please note that if an action is in the available items list, you can execute it immediately, without needing to change or move. First you should list your reasoning and create a plan, and then using that plan, select an action and create a JSON object for that action with the necessary info. The JSON object must be immediately after "Action: " as we're using regex to parse it.

Plan: 
Given the highest priority task is to "Chop Wood", Thomas should continue chopping wood until the tree stump's health is 0. Once the wood is collected, he would proceed to the chest (according to the 2nd priority task "Store wood in chest") and drop the wood there. 

At the moment, Thomas seems to be at a Tree Stump with 5/5 health. Therefore, he should swing his axe to chip away at the health of the stump and obtain the wood. Once done, he can move onto the next task.

Action: {"type": "SwingAxe", "data": {"characterId": "A1"}}
