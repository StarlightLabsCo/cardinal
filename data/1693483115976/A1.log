[1693483416615] [35m[CORTEX] Thomas Smith - Prior Message: [39mI'll coordinate with Lucy to chop some trees for the bonfire. I can't wait to continue exploring our beautiful forest. Do you think it might rain today? The forest's song is the loveliest during a downpour.

[1693483419261] [35m[CORTEX] Thomas Smith - Feel: [39mI feel eager for the communal activity but slightly anxious about the potential rain disrupting our plans
[1693483426506] [35m[CORTEX] Thomas Smith - Plan: [39m I am planning to team up with Lucy to chop trees in the forest for our bonfire. Depending on the weather forecast, the explorations will continue. If it's going to rain, I might need to make some adjustments and prepare for safety measures.
[1693483431479] [35m[CORTEX] Thomas Smith - Say: [39mLucy and I will get the trees for the bonfire. I too cherish the melody of the forest during a rainfall, but prefer to have clear skies for our activities. Let's prepare for both. How's the exploration going so far?
