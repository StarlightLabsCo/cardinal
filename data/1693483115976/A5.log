[1693483410644] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Plan: [39m Coordinate with Lucy to chop some trees for the bonfire and continue his exploration throughout the forest, ultimately aspiring to learn more about nature and its storytelling ways. He also has plans to climb more trees to broaden his view of the world and is looking forward to the sounds of the forest during the next rain.
[1693483416615] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Say: [39mI'll coordinate with Lucy to chop some trees for the bonfire. I can't wait to continue exploring our beautiful forest. Do you think it might rain today? The forest's song is the loveliest during a downpour.

[1693483431480] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Prior Message: [39mLucy and I will get the trees for the bonfire. I too cherish the melody of the forest during a rainfall, but prefer to have clear skies for our activities. Let's prepare for both. How's the exploration going so far?
