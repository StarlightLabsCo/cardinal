[1691991383805] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Explain: [39mI find your words challenging rather than discouraging, Thomas. The forest may be indifferent, but its aloofness makes the adventure of exploring it even more thrilling. Every seemingly trivial detail in the forest, be it a squawking bird or a rustling leaf, could be a key to uncovering a new secret. And as for your indifference, well, you wouldn't be sharing this advice if you didn't care, would you? So, in a way, your words only boost my enthusiasm to delve deeper into the forest and find those hidden secrets.
