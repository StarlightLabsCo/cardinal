[1692129014646] [36m[CORTEX] Character 2 - Say: [39mWell, Will, just like working in the forest, mining is a job that requires patience and respect for where we work. Always follow the safety rules, don't rush, and learn to understand the mine, much like how I listen to the forest. Nature has a way of speaking to us. We just need to learn how to listen.
