[1692128987065] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Plan: [39m To continue building his skills as a miner, continue engaging with Lucy Wilde and the other miners to learn about their experiences, and share his own adventures with his family back at home. He wants to manage his tools better so as to avoid another incident like the broken pickaxe. Finally, he's planning to explore more of the mines, and get used to the sounds and atmosphere of the mining environment.
[1692128995417] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Say: [39mToday was both an exciting and daunting experience. Going into the mines for the first time was something I've waited for my whole life and it was just as extraordinary as I'd imagined. Yet, I realize there's a lot I need to learn. Lucy, could you perhaps share any advice or experiences that might help me get better at mining?

[1692129019474] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Feel: [39mI feel enlightened by Lucy's wise advice and am eager to apply her words about patience, safety, and respect for the mine into my work.
[1692129035552] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Explain: [39mLucy's words are sage, and it's clear I was a bit too eager and perhaps reckless on my first day. I was hurrying, not paying enough attention to my surroundings or the work itself, resulting in the broken pickaxe. But her advice puts things into perspective - I must be patient, respectful and safe. I'm understanding the nuances of this profession better and even though it's a slow process, I believe I've made significant progress towards my goal of becoming a good miner. I'll also take note of understanding the mine, akin to listening to nature, as that seems to be an interesting perspective that I'd overlooked.
[1692129037100] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Did I make progress? [39m[choice=yes]
[1692129038664] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Did I accomplish my goal? [39m[choice=yes]
[1692129043450] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 Goodbye: [39mThank you for your advice, Lucy. I appreciate your wisdom and I'll certainly do my best to apply it in the mines. I look forward to our future conversations. Goodbye for now, Lucy.
