Given the available information, pick the best available action to accomplish your tasks. Respond in JSON: { type: [ActionType], data: {characterId optional parameters}}. Please note that if an action is in the available items list, you can execute it immediately, without needing to change or move. First you should list your reasoning and create a plan, and then using that plan, select an action and create a JSON object for that action with the necessary info. The JSON object must be immediately after "Action: " as we're using regex to parse it.

[1691126719868]Plan: 
[1691126719869]- First, Thomas should go to the mine site since this is the highest priority task currently. He’ll need to keep his axe and sword with him for potential threats but the pickaxe is extra weight and he should drop it before moving.
- Once he reaches the mine site, he will mine ore as per his second priority task.
- Then he will store the mined ores.
- Next he’ll go to the lumberyard, he will need his axe to chop down trees, so he’ll grab it back up before he goes.
- Once at the lumberyard, he'll chop trees as per his fifth priority task.
- After he's finished chopping wood, he'll store the wood.
- After his work at the lumberyard is complete, he’ll check on the safety of the village. 
- Finally after all tasks are complete, he will take rest.

Given these steps, the first action should be to drop the pickaxe.

Given the available information, pick the best available action to accomplish your tasks. Respond in JSON: { type: [ActionType], data: {characterId optional parameters}}. Please note that if an action is in the available items list, you can execute it immediately, without needing to change or move. First you should list your reasoning and create a plan, and then using that plan, select an action and create a JSON object for that action with the necessary info. The JSON object must be immediately after "Action: " as we're using regex to parse it.

[1691126732640]Plan: 
[1691126732640]Given the tasks that Thomas has, the first task Thomas have is to move to the mine site. Given Thomas' current position (5.7, -57.9) and the mine site position (51, 17), he should move to the mine site first to start mining. The move to action can be taken without changing or moving any items in the inventory. 

Other tasks are dependent on the completion of this task such as mining ore or storing mined ores. Same thing applies for tasks related to lumberyard. 

Actions related to dropping items from inventory are not necessary at this point as none of the tasks demand for it.

[1691126743030]Plan: 
[1691126743030]Looking at the task list, the first task is to "Move to Mine Site". The location of the Mine Site has been remembered, it's at 51, 17. Therefore, the character needs to move to the mine site.

Also it can be seen that there's a limit to the character's inventory which currently is partially full. 

Following the plan, the best action would be for Thomas Smith to move to the Mine Site.

Given the available information, pick the best available action to accomplish your tasks. Respond in JSON: { type: [ActionType], data: {characterId optional parameters}}. Please note that if an action is in the available items list, you can execute it immediately, without needing to change or move. First you should list your reasoning and create a plan, and then using that plan, select an action and create a JSON object for that action with the necessary info. The JSON object must be immediately after "Action: " as we're using regex to parse it.
