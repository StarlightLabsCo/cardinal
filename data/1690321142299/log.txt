[1690321197889]Plan: 
[1690321197889]Since chopping wood is Thomas's highest priority task and he already is near a healthy tree with an axe, Thomas will first chop wood. The logs can then be transported to the chest, fulfilling the second priority task. Lastly, Thomas can then proceed to cook his dinner.

Reasoning:

1. The task "Chop wood" is of the highest priority and Thomas is already near a healthy tree with an axe in his inventory. So he will first chop the tree. 

2. Next, he needs to store the wood in a chest which will be accomplished once a sufficient amount of wood has been gathered from chopping.

3. Lastly, Thomas will cook his dinner, completing his list of tasks for the day.

[1690321215859]Plan: 
[1690321215859]Since the task is to chop wood and Thomas Smith has already hit the tree at the current location with his axe and the tree has 5 health remaining, he should not move to a different location but continue with the current one. 

While he'll need to eventually return to the chest that he remembers seeing to complete his second task of storing wood, his immediate task must be to continue chopping the wood at his current location because the tree is not yet fully chopped. Therefore the explicit action to be taken is SwingAxe. 

Reasoning:
- SwingAxe does not require moving from the current spot, hence saving time and energy.
- The current tree is half chopped, thus finishing chopping this one first is more efficient than starting a new tree.
- Completing the first task is the immediate priority before moving on to the next one in the list.

[1690321229781]Plan: 
[1690321229781]Since the first task in Thomas's list is to chop wood, and his current position allows him to interact and chop with the Tree Stump, it would make sense to execute the [SwingAxe] action and continue chopping the wood. Once the wood is collected, he can proceed to the next task and store it in the chest.

Reasoning:
- The character's main task is to chop wood, which implies using the axe on the Tree Stump. The Tree Stump is within the character's hitbox, so he doesn't need to move to start chopping.
- The remaining tasks can only be done after completing the first task.

[1690321243470]Looking at the active tasks, the first one is to Chop wood. As Thomas Smith is a lumberjack and he has an Axe in his inventory, he can now progress to chopping the closest tree that has full health. The nearest ones according to the information are at X: -0.6865366, Y: -1.433641; X: 2.38, Y: -1.65; and X: 0.86, Y: -2.57. Among these, the first one at X: -0.6865366, Y: -1.433641 is the closest. Therefore, he should move to that location.

[1690321258449]Plan: 
[1690321258450]Since the nearest tree is at [X: -0.6865366, Y: -1.433641], the most logical sequence of actions would be to chop down this tree. After chopping down the tree, Thomas Smith can pick up the wood, following his primary task of "Chop wood". After acquiring enough wood, the character should move to the chest at [X: -5.51, Y: -4.46] and store the wood inside it, aligning with the task "Store wood in chest". Once the wood is stored, Thomas Smith can proceed to "Cook dinner" tasked.

Currently, only the chop wood task is relevant because Thomas Smith is already located at the nearest tree (within the hitbox range), has an axe in his inventory, and the tree is healthy enough to chop down.

[1690321269883]Thomas Smith is currently at a tree that is at 50% health. His current task is to "Cut Wood," and he has the necessary tool (an axe) to do the task right now as "SwingAxe" is an available action. The plan is for Thomas to continue chopping down the tree which he currently located at until it is destroyed. It seems he started chopping the same tree recently ("Thomas Smith swong their axe at X: -0.5449716, Y: -1.363549 and hit 1 tree.") .

[1690321284917]Plan: 
[1690321284917]Given the prioritization of the tasks, Thomas should continue chopping wood until he has enough to satisfy the lumberjack task. Since the nearest tree is a stump, he should focus on chopping it. After he has gathered enough wood, he should move towards the chest (at X: -5.51, Y: -4.46) and store the wood in it. After, Thomas can focus on the third task according to the priority, which is to cook dinner. If there are dependencies for the "cook dinner" task not yet mentioned, it would be proper to plan for them.

[1690321304431]Plan: 
[1690321304431]Thomas Smith has Chop wood's task as high priority. He has successfully chopped few trees, seeing his inventory it suggests. That he has 5 out of 10 spaces occupied, which means he can continue chopping down trees. He is capable of chopping down at least one more tree. Then he will need to store the collected wood in the chest as mentioned in his second task, But first let's complete the first task.

Reasoning: Thomas can choose either of the available tree nearby to chop down. As per his memory, he has seen the trees 2 minutes ago but he can surely see those trees. So he choose to move to the very first one which is Tree at X: 0.86, Y: -2.57.

[1690321332895]Plan: 
[1690321332895]1. Thomas Smith is a lumberjack. His first task is to chop wood, which he is currently in the process of doing. He's standing near two trees, both with 5/10 health.
2. Once he's finished chopping the trees and collecting wood, he needs to store the wood in the chest. The nearest chest is quite far, at 6.537169m distance. He might need to plan out his route carefully, considering the health of his axe.
3. His last task is to cook dinner. However, there's no immediate information on how he's supposed to do that. The present action set doesn't include any cooking-related actions. Perhaps after he completes the first two tasks, he'll be able to get access to new actions.

Given this analysis and his current position, the best action would be to continue chopping the nearest trees, fulfilling the first task. After chopping down the trees, depending on the remaining health of the axe and his inventory capacity, he can decide whether to continue chopping more trees or move to the chest to store the wood.

Given the available information, pick the best available action to accomplish your tasks. Respond in JSON: { type: [ActionType], data: {characterId optional parameters}}. Please note that if an action is in the available items list, you can execute it immediately, without needing to change or move. First you should list your reasoning and create a plan, and then using that plan, select an action and create a JSON object for that action with the necessary info. The JSON object must be immediately after "Action: " as we're using regex to parse it.

[1690321353056]Plan: 
[1690321353056]Given Thomas' tasks are to Chop wood, Store wood in chest, and Cook dinner, he needs to execute them in the priority order provided.

He has an axe and he's close to a Tree Stump and a tree. Hence he should first chop wood from the tree. After that, he should pick up the wood, move closer to the chest and store the wood. Finally, he can start cooking the dinner.

However, he can only perform one action at a time.

Action: He should start by chopping the tree with the axe. The closest tree to him is at X: -0.42, Y: -3.52.

Let's create the suitable JSON object to perform this action:

[1690321368209]Plan: 
[1690321368209]Given the tasks at hand, the character, Thomas Smith, should first perform his highest priority task, which is to "Chop wood". After evaluating his environment, there's a tree within his hitbox which he can chop using the axe in his inventory. After he's done chopping enough wood, he should perform the second priority task, which is to "Store wood in the chest". The chest is located at [X: -5.51, Y: -4.46]. Finally, he can proceed with the third task which is to "Cook dinner".

Now for the immediate action, since a tree is within his hitbox, he should perform the "SwingAxe" action to chop the tree.

[1690321389566]Plan: 
[1690321389566]1. Based on priorities, the first task I need to focus on is 'Chop wood'. Looking at the environment, the closest tree with good health is located at X: -0.42, Y: -3.52. 
2. After handling the first priority, the next task to focus on will be 'Store wood in chest'. The chest is located quite far away at X: -5.51, Y: -4.46. 
3. Lastly for the 'Cook dinner', I don't have information on it yet. I will need to find a fire or anything related to cooking before I can do this task.

Given these steps, I will start with Step 1 first which is to chop the nearest tree. Since Thomas is already adjacent to a tree, he can start chopping immediately.

[1690321414870]Plan: 
[1690321414870]Looking at the tasks of Thomas Smith, his first priority is to chop wood, then store it in the chest, and finally cook dinner. 

Thomas 's inventory shows he only has one more slot available and he has an axe which he can use to chop down more trees. His memories and environment clearly state that there is a tree stump right next to him. 

So, my plan would be to first clear some of the trees surrounding him, with his axe, to get the wood. Then, once the inventory is filled up to limitation of 10, he will go to the chest which is located at the coordinates (-5.51, -4.46), and leave the wood there, thereby creating more space in his inventory. After subtask of chopping wood and storing it has been done, he will proceed to cook dinner which doesn't seem to hold any strategic or game-oriented value as far as the current situation is concerned.

For now, the action I will use second SwingAxe action again to clear the wood from the tree stump that is within Thomas's reach. This will help in accomplishing his first task in the priority list.

[1690321430750]Plan: 
[1690321430750]Based on the tasks Thomas Smith needs to perform and his current resources, it is clear that Smith should continue chopping wood as it is his first priority. He already has an Axe in his inventory and there are still trees nearby. Once he is done chopping wood, or his inventory is full, he should move to the chest (-5.51, -4.46) to store his gathered wood. After successfully storing wood, Smith can proceed to cook dinner, which is his third and final task. 

For now, the best available action is to continue chopping wood. First, he should move closer to the next tree, then he should swing his axe to topple it.

[1690321443655]Plan: 
[1690321443655]Thomas's main task is to chop wood, and his inventory has room for just one more. Since there are two trees within his hitbox, he should first swing the axe to try to obtain more wood. After this, since his inventory would be full, it's best to carry out his second task - store wood in chest. He would then need to move to the chest's location to drop the wood.

[1690321460921]Plan: 
[1690321460923]1. Thomas should finish chopping the trees around him to gather more wood, as his first priority task is to chop wood.
2. Once his inventory is full, Thomas should move to the chest at location X: -5.51, Y: -4.46 to store the wood he has collected, as his second priority task is to store wood in chest.
3. After storing the wood, Thomas should carry out his other tasks.

Given this plan, the best action to accomplish your tasks would be to keep chopping wood as he currently has space in his inventory.

[1690321475752]Plan: 
[1690321475752]1) Because Thomas Smith's inventory is full with 9 woods and an axe, he needs to store the woods in the chest which is at X: -5.51, Y: -4.46.
2) Then he can continue with task 1 - "Chop wood".

Reasoning:
Given the Task priority, it would seem that Thomas should first chop wood. However, his inventory is full. It's best to store the wood in the chest and free up the inventory. Once his inventory is less cluttered, he can return to complete task 1.

Action:
The action Thomas Smith should take is moving towards the chest to deposit 9 wood from his inventory. Thus, here is the JSON action sequence.

[1690321491229]Plan: 
[1690321491229]Based on Thomas Smith's tasks, he must first chop wood before he stores it in the chest. Considering his location near a chest and his full inventory (full of wood), it seems most logical to first store the wood into the chest to free up inventory space. Once the wood has been stored, Thomas Smith can proceed to chop more wood.

[1690321507269]Plan: 
[1690321507269]According to the character's tasks, and the environment and inventory details, the first task is to chop wood, with priority 1. Currently there are no trees nearby within swinging range. The closest tree is at coordinates X: -0.48, Y: -5.31, with a distance of 4.996482m. Thomas Smith should move towards this tree.

Reasoning:
To finish the task of chopping wood, Thomas has to be in close range to a tree. Since the closest tree is at X: -0.48, Y: -5.31, Thomas needs to move towards it. Once he is within range, he can begin chopping.

Given the available information, pick the best available action to accomplish your tasks. Respond in JSON: { type: [ActionType], data: {characterId optional parameters}}. Please note that if an action is in the available items list, you can execute it immediately, without needing to change or move. First you should list your reasoning and create a plan, and then using that plan, select an action and create a JSON object for that action with the necessary info. The JSON object must be immediately after "Action: " as we're using regex to parse it.

[1690321523356]Plan: 
[1690321523356]Given Thomas Smith's high priority task is to chop wood and he is already close to healthy trees, the reasonable first action is to swing the axe to chop wood. Then, Thomas should move to the chest to store the wood. Finally, as he is brave, calm, and honest he won't steal wood, but rather find it in his working environment such as near tree stumps instead.

[1690321539759]Plan: 
[1690321539760]First, Thomas should complete his first task of chopping wood. The trees that he can hit with his current position could provide that wood. After he has gathered enough, then he should store the wood in the chest for task two. His third task of cooking dinner might require other resources that are not currently visible in his environment. However, if he has the necessary resources, he should execute that task last in order to ensure that the food is fresh and warm.

So, first, he should keep swinging his axe at the trees in his hitbox until he has gathered enough wood, then move to the chest to deposit wood, and then look for resources for cooking dinner if they are available.

[1690321550978]Plan: 
[1690321550979]Since Thomas Smith's first task is to chop wood, and he is in immediate vicinity of two tree stumps, he should accomplish this task by swinging his axe. Not only does this complete his first task, but it also allows him to gather more wood, which can be used to complete his second task of storing wood in the chest. After accomplishing these two tasks, Thomas can move onto his third task of cooking dinner.

[1690321567965]Plan: 
[1690321567965]First, Thomas will chop wood until his inventory is full. Then, he will go to the nearest chest and deposit it. Afterwards, he will continue to chop wood until it's time to cook dinner. 

Reasoning:

Thomas' highest priority task is to chop wood. It's true that his inventory is currently full, but he can still chop down trees. The resulting wood will simply go on the floor near him, which he can pick up after he clears some space in his inventory by depositing his current wood in the chest. His second highest priority is to store wood in the chest, so as soon as his inventory is full, he should walk to the nearest chest and deposit it. Finally, his third task is to cook dinner, but it's not a high priority task yet, so he should focus on chopping wood and storing it in the chest first.

[1690321593203]Plan: 
[1690321593203]First, since Thomas's inventory is full, he should store some of the wood in the chest. Then, he should move to the nearest tree and collect more wood as his highest priority task is to "Chop wood". Once he has enough wood, he can proceed to "Cook dinner".

Reasoning: Since the state of the environment shows that wood is a crucial item and it is also the requirement for Thomas's next task, storing his current wood items in the chest will not only help clear inventory space but also secure the items he already has. Then, getting more wood will help him advance to the tasks on his list.

[1690321611306]Plan: 
[1690321611306]Based on the tasks and the available information Thomas Smith is in a location very close to a chest and has recently stored wood in that chest. The most high-priority task is to chop wood. He is not near any trees or stumps to chop, so he will need to move to them. The nearest tree is at coordinates (2.72,-5.11). So, he should move to that tree to chop it. After chopping the tree, he might go back to the chest to store the wood which is second priority task. After that he needs to cook dinner which is a task the assistant isn't able to help with due to the constraints.

Given the available information, pick the best available action to accomplish your tasks. Respond in JSON: { type: [ActionType], data: {characterId optional parameters}}. Please note that if an action is in the available items list, you can execute it immediately, without needing to change or move. First you should list your reasoning and create a plan, and then using that plan, select an action and create a JSON object for that action with the necessary info. The JSON object must be immediately after "Action: " as we're using regex to parse it.

[1690321673327]Plan: 
[1690321673327]Thomas Smith, our lumberjack character, is currently standing close to a Tree with health 10/10. His Axes 'Swing' action's hitbox currently overlaps this Tree, which means he can execute a chopping action without needing to Move there first.

His inventory is full with Wood, since the capacity is 10/10, which consists of one Axe and nine blocks of Wood. The Tasks assigned to him have Chop Wood as the first priority task. Since he can't store any more Wood in his inventory, he can't fulfill this task directly. He also needs to Store Wood in a chest which is the second priority task; the closest Chest to Thomas is quite a distance away (8.12m).

Given this information, my proposal would be for Thomas to store the Wood he has in his inventory first, the second priority task. Clearing up the inventory will help him carry out the first priority task of chopping the wood. Therefore, the immediate action should be for Thomas to move to the closest Chest located at X: -5.51, Y: -4.46.

Then, once he reaches the chest, he should transfer the Wood from his inventory to the Chest. After that, he can return to the trees and continue with the task of Chopping Wood. So, his task execution should be as follows: Move -> Transfer Wood -> Move -> Swing Axe.

[1690321688837]Plan: 
[1690321688837]Since Thomas' inventory is full and the tasks in hand are to chop wood and store wood in the chest, he should drop the extra wood on the ground next to the chest, which would free up space in his inventory. Then he can move towards the nearest tree, chop the wood and store the wood in the chest.

[1690321701319]First, Thomas should chop more wood since his inventory is not full and chopping wood is his highest-priority task. After chopping the wood, he should store the wood in the chest, which is his second highest-priority task. Finally, he should prepare for his third task by moving towards a location with ingredients necessary for cooking dinner.

[1690321724109]Plan: 
[1690321724109]Thomas Smith’s highest priority task right now is to chop more wood, but his inventory is full. When he adds wood to the chest, however, he's on track to meet his second highest priority, store wood in chest. After these two tasks, Thomas can proceed to the third task which is to cook dinner. 

Action: 

Option    : One
Reasoning : Thomas Smith can't currently chop more wood, as his inventory is full with wood. He needs to free up some space. Therefore, he should add his wood to the nearby chest. The chest is within the hitbox, so no need to move.

Option    : Two
Reasoning : Thomas can move to one of the visible trees in the environment to chop more wood. The closest tree is at coordinates X: 2.72, Y: -5.11. But as per his task, he needs to first empty his bag before proceeding to chop the wood. 

Based on the options, it would be reasonable to first execute Option One, freeing up inventory space to enable further wood chopping.

[1690321744436]Plan: 
[1690321744436]1. According to his tasks, Thomas Smith's highest priority is to chop wood. He has 8 pieces of wood in his inventory, but the hitbox shows a chest within reach, not a tree or tree stump. Therefore, moveThomas towards the nearest tree or tree stump to chop at.
2. Once Thomas reaches the tree or tree stump, he should execute a SwingAxe action to chop it down and gather more wood.
3. After he has chopped down the tree or tree stump, Thomas needs to store the wood he has collected in the chest he has seen earlier. He should first move back to the chest. If the inventory has runout of space, he should move to the chest immediately and clear his inventory as well.
4. Thomas will then execute the AddItemToChest action to store the wood.
5. After that, Thomas can then begin to carry out his third task of cooking dinner, but that seems to be out of scope currently.

[1690321764017]Plan: 
[1690321764017]Firstly, Thomas should complete the task of chopping wood, as it has the priority of 1 and also because the hitbox information indicates that a nearby tree can be hit with a swing based action. After the tree has been cut down and wood is collected, it should be deposited in the nearest chest, which fulfills the second priority task. Even though the chest has a greater distance compared to other objects or trees, the order of tasks needs to be maintained.

After these two tasks have been done, depending on the time and remaining wood in the chest, Thomas can either chop more wood or begin preparing dinner.

Based on this, the best immediate action should be to chop down the tree as part of the assigned task.

[1690321784676]Plan: 
[1690321784676]Thomas Smith needs to continue chopping wood before it gets too dark. With an axe in his possession and a tree within reach, he can carry on the task right away.

After chopping enough wood, his second task would then be to store the wood in the chest. The chest is at a different position so he would need to note down its position for later use.

Considering these planned activities, for now, Thomas Smith should continue chopping the wood. 

The action for this would be to use the [SwingAxe] action since there's a tree within his hitbox. This would allow him to chop wood without having to move. However, he might need to move later to drop the chopped wood in the chest or if there are no more trees within his reach. 

For the JSON action object, this would be:

[1690321808838]Plan: 
[1690321808838]Given the character's current status, highest priority task is to chop wood and his inventory is full - he has an axe and 9 wood blocks. He is also at striking distance from a Tree Stump. Keeping this in mind, the best course of action for Thomas would be to first make room in his inventory by depositing some wood into the chest (which is the second task on his list). However, the chest is about 8.134927m away, which would take some time. Alternatively, we can consider dropping some wood at his current location and regain those after chopping the tree, but it may be more efficient to store the items properly at first in order to keep things organized and easy to find later. Therefore, Thomas should move to the chest, deposit the wood, and return back to chop more wood.

Given the available information, pick the best available action to accomplish your tasks. Respond in JSON: { type: [ActionType], data: {characterId optional parameters}}. Please note that if an action is in the available items list, you can execute it immediately, without needing to change or move. First you should list your reasoning and create a plan, and then using that plan, select an action and create a JSON object for that action with the necessary info. The JSON object must be immediately after "Action: " as we're using regex to parse it.

[1690321834188]Plan: 
[1690321834189]1. Even though Thomas Smith currently has a full inventory, the priority task is chopping wood. He sees several tree stumps around him. Tree stumps can still yield wood when chopped, so he should approach one of the closer tree stumps and swing his axe at it.
2. After chopping wood, he will need to move towards the chest to deposit the wood because his inventory will be even fuller. Although his inventory is currently full, the chopping wood task could potentially create an exception.
3. To open up space in his inventory, he gets to store some of the wood in the chest (the second priority task). After that, his inventory should have room for the additional wood.
4. The last task, cook dinner, isn't immediate, and there's no immediate information regarding tools or materials for cooking. Thomas can focus on the first two tasks for now.

Action: Select the closest tree stump, move towards it, and swing the axe to chop more wood.

[1690321849554]Plan: 
[1690321849554]Our highest priority task is to chop wood. As Thomas's inventory is full, we first need to drop some wood to free up space for the newly chopped wood. Then we can use the MoveTo action to reach the tree stump at the nearest distance, which is 0.1476489m away at X: 0.86, Y: -2.57. Once there, we can execute the SwingAxe action to chop wood from the stump.

[1690321861485]Plan: 
[1690321861485]Since Thomas's current task is to chop wood, the best action would be to use his axe to chop a nearby tree stump. The nearest stump is at X: 0.86, Y: -2.57, and is in the hitbox. Therefore, Thomas doesn't need to move. After chopping the wood, Thomas can deposit it in the chest, and once all the chopping is done, he can start to cook dinner.

[1690321877647]Plan: 
[1690321877647]The character's highest priority task is to chop wood, which he can do using the axe in his inventory. However, the character's inventory is full with wood, which may prevent the acquisition of additional wood. Thus, the wood in the inventory should be sorted out first, fulfilling the second priority of storing the wood in the chest. The nearest chest is at co-ordinates -5.51, -4.46. The character should walk to this chest and store the wood.

[1690321906671]Plan: 
[1690321906671]Since the priority task is to chop wood and there is one remaining Wood item within the vicinity, the best coarse of action for Thomas would be to move towards that Wood item and proceed to chop it. Currently, Thomas's inventory is at full capacity; thus, assuming that chopping wood would require him to pick up the resulting Wood item, he would have to first create room in his inventory by dropping an existing Wood item from his inventory.

Reasoning:
Priority-wise, 'Chop wood' has the highest importance, followed by 'Store wood in chest' and 'Cook dinner'. This suggests that our prime focus should be on gathering wood, and storing and cooking can follow. Thomas's inventory currently contains maximum items, with Wood occupying most of the space. Since chopping wood will also create a Wood item, which Thomas will need to pick up, he needs to make space in his inventory. So, he can drop a Wood from his inventory to the ground, freeing up a slot. The closest Wood item (with ID 221a540a-6100-41a9-bdf2-85785d6262f8) detected is at coordinates -0.6571094,-6.294017 about 5.095361m away from his current position. So, once the Wood is dropped, Thomas can then head to this location to chop wood.

[1690321920122]Plan: 
[1690321920122]1. Checking the tasks priorities, Thomas needs to chop wood as the first priority which he is doing right now.
2. His inventory shows that he already has 8 woods and it is 9/10 full.
3. He has just dropped one on the ground.
4. His second priority task is to store in the chest, which is in his hitbox.
5. Therefore, the next best action would be to pick up the wood he has dropped and store it in the chest.

[1690321929728]Plan: 
[1690321929728]Thomas's goal is to chop more wood until his inventory is full, then store the wood in the chest, moving to move to each item or location as needed. The current task according to priority is to chop more wood, so the next action should be to move towards the nearest wood, located at X: -5.471782, Y: -4.374951.

Therefore, the next action will be a MoveTo action to the location of the closest wood.

[1690321945521]Plan: 
[1690321945521]Firstly, Thomas Smith's inventory is full at the moment and the closest visible item is a chest. So, Thomas can deposit wood into the chest to clear some space in the inventory. Secondly, his highest priority task is to chop wood. Thus, after depositing wood, he can move to the closest stump and chop it. Lastly, he can store the chopped wood back into the chest and repeat the process until he completes his tasks for the day.

[1690321961477]Plan: 
[1690321961477]1. Thomas should chop wood until the inventory limit is reached.
2. Move to the chest to store the collected wood. 
3. If there are more trees to chop, repeat the process.
4. Once there is no more wood to gather or the task is marked as complete, proceed to cook dinner.

From the given data, the action to take now is to chop wood. Thomas can move to the piece of wood closest to him, swing his axe, and add the collected wood to his inventory till capacity is reached. After that, he can move to the chest to store the wood. He can then return to gather more wood if needed, repeating the process until the task is complete. Once all the wood is collected and stored, he can proceed to cook dinner.

Given the available information, pick the best available action to accomplish your tasks. Respond in JSON: { type: [ActionType], data: {characterId optional parameters}}. Please note that if an action is in the available items list, you can execute it immediately, without needing to change or move. First you should list your reasoning and create a plan, and then using that plan, select an action and create a JSON object for that action with the necessary info. The JSON object must be immediately after "Action: " as we're using regex to parse it.

[1690321985227]--- Response ---
[1690321985227]Plan: 
[1690321985227]1. As his inventory is full, Thomas should proceed with the task of storing wood in the chest, which is the second priority. 
2. He should move to the location of the chest which is located at X: -5.51, Y: -4.46. 
3. Then he will drop the wood from his inventory to the chest.
4. Now his inventory will be free again to chop more wood as per task-1 if needed.

Reasoning: As the top priority task is to chop wood but Thomas' inventory is already full, he should complete the second priority task first. In this task, he will empty his inventory into the chest, freeing up space to chop more wood.

[1690321998124]Plan: 
[1690321998124]Based on Thomas' tasks, the highest priority task is Chop Wood, but as the inventory is full, he won't be able to carry any more wood. So, the second highest priority task is to Store Wood in Chest. Therefore, Thomas should store the wood he is carrying in the chest before moving on to chop more wood.

[1690322020806]Plan: 
[1690322020806]The top priority task is to chop some more wood. There is no mention of an available tree immediately nearby, but there is a tree stump located at X: 1.22, Y: -4.18 (distance: 6.623615m), which needs to be approached. Thomas should move towards the tree stump to swing his axe.

Reasoning: 
Thomas has an open space in his inventory (9/10), which would likely be filled by chopped wood. Since his top priority task is to chop wood, he should start moving towards the closest wood source, which is the tree stump at X: 1.22, Y: -4.18. He should head to this location to chop some additional wood and fulfill his top task. He will then likely need to return to the chest to deposit this wood, as it's also a part of his tasks (however, this will be addressed in the next step).

Given the available information, pick the best available action to accomplish your tasks. Respond in JSON: { type: [ActionType], data: {characterId optional parameters}}. Please note that if an action is in the available items list, you can execute it immediately, without needing to change or move. First you should list your reasoning and create a plan, and then using that plan, select an action and create a JSON object for that action with the necessary info. The JSON object must be immediately after "Action: " as we're using regex to parse it.

[1690322041774]Plan: 
[1690322041774]Based on the tasks and the state of the environment, the next step that would make the most sense for Thomas would be to continue chopping wood since that is his highest priority task (priority 1). Right now, Thomas is within the hitbox range of two tree stumps. As his inventory is full, he will drop the wood, make space for new one, and continue chopping.

After sufficient wood is collected, he would move towards the chest (priority 2 task) to deposit the wood. Deposit task would require moving to x: -5.51, y: -4.46.
 
Finally, Thomas can think about cooking dinner, but that would depend on completing the first two tasks.

Plan:
1. Chop wood from the tree stump 
2. Move to the chest 
3. Deposit wood in the chest 
4. Cook dinner (if applicable)

[1690322064021]Plan: 
[1690322064021]Thomas Smith has completed his first task of chopping wood. His inventory is currently full with wood which he needs to deposit into a nearby chest to complete his second priority task "Store wood in chest". Afterwards he can proceed with his third task of cooking dinner.

Given his current location (1.074705, -4.21969), the closest chest to him is at (-5.51, -4.46). He needs to move to this location and deposit his wood.

Best Available Action: Move to the chest location

Reasoning: As Thomas already has enough wood (9 pieces) in his inventory, he can move ahead to do the next task of storing the wood into the chest. The chest at (-5.51, -4.46) is currently the closest, so he can move to this location to store his wood.

[1690322078488]Plan: 
[1690322078488]Thomas Smith has three tasks, which are chop wood, store wood in chest, and cook dinner. Since the highest priority task is to chop wood and he has an axe in his inventory, he should chop the nearest wood. After chopping the wood, he can store it in the chest, then finally cook dinner. 

Given their current tasks, their priority should be to chop the nearest wood.

[1690322097368]Plan: 
[1690322097368]Thomas Smith is a hardworking Lumberjack, currently occupied with chopping wood. However, his inventory is full, which prevents him from collecting any more wood. Therefore, the best course of action would be to drop some wood to create space in the inventory for storing more wood. 

So the plan is:
First, Thomas should drop some wood from his inventory to create space. Dropping only one piece of wood from the inventory should do, as it's necessary for him to have some wood for other tasks.
Once there is space, he can return to chopping wood.
Sorting wood into the chest can come later, as per the given task priority.

[1690322114482]Plan: 
[1690322114482]Thomas Smith has completed his first task "Chop wood". Thomas still has 9 pieces of wood in his inventory which he can deposit in the chest. His current location X: 0.03977751, Y: -6.022524 is relatively far away from the chest X: -5.51, Y: -4.46. It would be the best to move to the chest location to deposit the remaining wood. Then he can start cooking the dinner as his third task considering inventory has space and other required items for cooking are available.

Best Available Action:

The best available action for Thomas Smith right now would be moving near the chest for storing the wood. Thus, the JSON data object would be - Moving to the chest location.

[1690322127828]Thomas needs first to fulfill his highest priority task, which is chopping wood. However, his inventory is already full. Thus, he must deposit some of his collected wood in the nearby chest to create space in his inventory. Since the chest is in his hitbox, there's no need to move.

[1690322141154]Plan: 
[1690322141154]The task of priority is chopping more wood. From the environment data, there are several pieces of wood scattered around. The nearest wood is approximately 6.63 meters away. Given that Thomas is a brave and calm character, he is unlikely to be deterred by the distance and is more likely to focus on efficiency related to his tasks which in this case cutting more wood. Therefore, he should move to the location of the nearest wood to chop.

Given the available information, pick the best available action to accomplish your tasks. Respond in JSON: { type: [ActionType], data: {characterId optional parameters}}. Please note that if an action is in the available items list, you can execute it immediately, without needing to change or move. First you should list your reasoning and create a plan, and then using that plan, select an action and create a JSON object for that action with the necessary info. The JSON object must be immediately after "Action: " as we're using regex to parse it.

[1690322157995]Plan: 
[1690322157995]1. Check inventory for available space. It appears to be fully occupied currently with the Axe and 9 pieces of Wood. 
2. Since the Chest isn't yet in range (6.608111m away) and the inventory is full, the best course of action would be to move closer to the Chest.
3. After reaching the Chest, deposit the Wood from the inventory into the Chest to free up space.
4. Once space is cleared, proceed back towards the closest piece of Wood or Tree to gather more wood, depending on whether the 'Chop wood' task has been accomplished or not.

[1690322173930]Plan: 
[1690322173930]1. Thomas Smith's first task is to chop wood, but his inventory is full which means he can't do this yet.
2. His second task is to store wood in the chest so he should do this next.
3. The third task, cooking dinner, is not immediately actionable based on available actions and considerations.
4. Once the inventory is not full (after completing task 2), Thomas can go back to task 1 and chop more wood.

[1690322196932]Plan: 
[1690322196932]Given that Thomas Smith's highest priority task is to chop wood, which requires visibility of the said wood, and the currently visible 'Wood' being at a distance greater than 7m, he should first move to a random 'Wood' target. We recall that Thomas Smith had successfully chopped down trees and obtained wood in his previous actions, meaning that he likely still has his axe. Therefore, he doesn't need to check or equip an axe at this stage.

After moving to the 'Wood', Thomas Smith should execute a 'SwingAxe' action to perform the task of chopping wood. The next action will vary based on the success or failure of the 'SwingAxe' action.

If Thomas successfully obtains wood from the 'SwingAxe' action, he should attempt to add it to his inventory. Meanwhile, keep track of the inventory capacity; if the capacity is full (10/10), then the task of storing wood in the chest comes next. He should move to the chest's location and deposit the wood in it.

If at any moment Thomas's health drops significantly or an emergency scenario occurs (which can often occur in the wilderness!), the plans may change depending on the nature of the situation.

Now, assuming everything is normal, his next action would be to move to the 'Wood' at X: 2.211924, Y: -4.054522 as its the closest from his location.

[1690322209109]Plan: 
[1690322209109]Firstly, my task is to chop wood which I have already seen around according to my memories. I got to move to the wood that I can see in my environment, then swing my axe on it to collect it. Afterwards, I should also move to the chest that I have seen in my environment and store the wood in it. Lastly, since the task to cook dinner is not a high priority task yet, I can postpone it until after I have completed my current tasks. Therefore, the first thing that I'm going to do is to move to the nearest piece of wood, which is Item ID: 79836553-757b-4a95-800d-c407907afbbd located at X: 2.211924, Y: -4.054522.

[1690322228056]Plan: 
[1690322228056]Given Thomas' tasks, the first task is to chop wood. Since Thomas is carrying a full inventory of wood( 9 Wood), it is impossible to acquire more by chopping down another tree. Therefore, the next logical step is to complete the second task, which is to store the wood in the chest. After completing this task, Thomas will then have space in his inventory so he can continue chopping wood.

[1690322245438]Plan: 
[1690322245439]Starting with the highest priority task, Thomas needs to chop wood. However, since his inventory is already full, he would not be able to add any more wood to his inventory. Therefore, he must first free up some space. He can do so by executing his second priority task, which is to store the wood in the chest. Once his inventory has some free space, he can then proceed to chop wood. After he has chopped and stored enough wood, he can proceed to his third task, which is to cook dinner.  

The first action should then be to store the wood in the chest.

[1690322256988]Plan: 
[1690322256988]Given that Thomas still has available space in his inventory and the highest priority task is to chop wood, it is reasonable to assume that he needs to move towards the closest located wood in order to chop it and add it to his inventory. This decision also accounts for the idea that Thomas will be performing tasks according to their priority order.

[1690322278284]Plan: 
[1690322278284]First, Thomas should chop more wood as his inventory is depleted of wood, and his first task is to chop wood. To do this, Thomas will have to go near a tree and swing his axe towards it. The nearest tree is 2.67m away at coordinates (4.14, -3.64). Thomas should first move to the tree and prepare to chop it for additional wood to replenish his inventory. After gathering some more wood, he should move to the chest and deposit the wood there, which is his second priority task. The chest is located at coordinates (-5.51, -4.46) and is 7.67m away. Cooking dinner, the third task, isn't relevant at the moment as the current situation mostly involves chopping and storing wood. 

Given this plan, the first action Thomas should take is to move to the nearest tree to chop it down.

[1690322292304]Plan: 
[1690322292304]1. Thomas should first accomplish the "Chop wood" task, given its priority.
2. Since the Tree is in Thomas' current hitbox, he doesn't need to move.
3. Although his inventory is full, he may still be able to perform the "SwingAxe" action; the game mechanics might enable dropping the wood automatically if the inventory is full.
4. Once the Tree is chopped down, and the wood is in the inventory or on the ground, we can move on to the next tasks.

Reasoning:

The JSON command should command Thomas to perform a "SwingAxe" action. This action will allow Thomas to cut down the tree, which is in his hitbox, thus accomplishing the highest priority task in his task list.

[1690322303382]Plan: 
[1690322303382]The highest priority task for character Thomas Smith is to chop wood. However, since his inventory is already full (10/10), he cannot collect any more wood. His second high-priority task is to store the wood in a chest. Based on his recent actions, the last known chest location is at X: -5.51, Y: -4.46. Therefore, he should move to the chest location and store the wood.

[1690322319484]Plan: 
[1690322319484]Given the current state, the best available action plan seems to be:
1) Traverse to the wood at the specified coordinates as the first task priority is to "Chop wood".
2) Swing the axe to chop wood.
3) Return to the chest to store the additional wood as per task priority 2.

Therefore, the immediate action should be moving to the wood's location first.

[1690322342285]Plan: 
[1690322342285]Since the character, Thomas Smith is a brave, calm, and honest lumberjack, he adhers to his tasks and responsibilities. Looking at his current tasks, priority is given to "Chop wood", followed by "Store wood in chest", and then "Cook dinner". Since Thomas's inventory is full right now with Wood and his Axe, it restricts him from collecting more Wood.

His immediate environment includes several pieces of Wood and a Tree that he can chop, however, his inventory is full and doesn't allow him to carry more Wood. The nearest chest to store the Wood is quite far away.

Thomas should first move to the nearest Chest to clear up some space in his inventory. This will allow him to take up his highest priority task which is to chop more Wood. After clearing his inventory, he should then return to the nearest Tree or Wood and chop or collect more before returning to the chest again to store collected Wood. His last task would be to cook dinner.

[1690322365117]Plan: 
[1690322365117]The first priority task is to chop wood, however, there is no mention of any tree (or source of wood) nearby, and Thomas's inventory is already full with wood so he wouldn't be able to carry any more wood.

So the best course of action seems to be moving on to the remaining tasks.

The second task is to store wood in the chest but since the chest is at maximum capacity, this task can also not be performed.

The third task is to cook dinner; there isn't any specific information about required items or the location of a fireplace where he could cook dinner. Therefore it seems like the system should generate additional actions to help this situation.

Given all these factors, it is safe to say that currently, the character cannot directly perform any tasks, and it would seem illogical for Thomas to perform any of the available actions, as none would help accomplish the tasks at hand.

Additional information is needed to progress further.

Action: None

[1690322377059]Plan: 
[1690322377059]Thomas Smith's highest priority task is to chop wood, but his inventory is full, residing 9 Wood and 1 Axe. Therefore, depositing some wood in the chest can make room for more chopped wood. To accomplish that, he could execute the AddItemToChest action to put the Wood from his inventory into the chest.

Reasoning:
Since Smith is standing right next to the chest (Distance: 0.1449552m), the AddItemToChest action can be executed immediately. Additionally, his inventory is already full, so to move forward with his Task 1 (Chop wood), he has to first clear up some space from his inventory.

[1690322393396]Plan: 
[1690322393397]Thomas Smith currently has the tasks of chopping wood, storing wood in the chest and cooking dinner.

He has already obtained 8 pieces of wood, so the first task of chopping wood has been achieved. The chest is within a very short distance from him. So the optimal thing to do would be to store the wood in the chest and thereby completing the second task. Since we have not been informed of the availability of cooking tools or food, we cannot determine if the third task can be accomplished right now.

Based on these conditions, the best available action for Thomas Smith would be to add the wood from his inventory to the chest. The JSON object for this action is as follows:

Action: 
{ "type": "AddItemToChest", "data": { "characterId": "A1", "chestId": "chest_(-5.51,-4.46)", "itemId": "wood" }}

[1690322410233]Plan: 
[1690322410233]Thomas Smith's first priority task is to chop wood, which requires him to have an axe equipped. Upon examining Thomas' inventory, it is evident that he has an axe. For the chopping to begin, Thomas should therefore move to the location of the wood. Once the wood is chopped, Thomas' following task of storing wood in the chest would require him to move to the chest's location. Upon storing the wood in the chest, Thomas can then proceed to his third prioritized task of cooking dinner.

Action: 
To follow through with the plan, Thomas' first action would be to move towards the location of the wood. Hence, the best action to choose at this moment would be 'MoveTo'.

[1690322433826]Plan: 
[1690322433826]Given his current position, Thomas Smith should follow his list of tasks starting from the highest priority. His first task is to chop wood, and there are two pieces of wood nearby. Since Thomas has an axe in his inventory, he can straightaway start chopping the wood without needing to move. 

After chopping the wood, if his inventory still have space, he should pick up the chopped wood. Based on the priority list, his second task is to store wood in a chest. There is a chest available in the environment which is, however, quite far from his current position. He can move to the chest's location and store the wood once he has collected it. 

His third task is to cook dinner, but from the given information, it's not clear whether he has the necessary items and facilities to cook dinner. 

The priority of the tasks and the available Actions guide to first start with chopping the wood.

[1690322451882]Plan: 
[1690322451883]First, following the tasks priority, Thomas Smith needs to continue to chopping wood. Currently, there is a tree within a reachable distance (1.92149m), so Thomas Smith should move to its location. Upon reaching the tree, Thomas Smith will need to swing the axe to chop it down.

After chopping wood, Thomas Smith can then pick up the wood and store it in the chest, which would be the second priority.
Cooking dinner would be the last task on the list, but more important information, such as whether there is food to cook or where the cooking place, is needed, so we aren't able to plan it yet.

Therefore, the first action to do is to move Thomas towards the tree.

[1690322464841]Plan: 
[1690322464841]The priority task is to chop wood.
Considering that there is a healthy tree within swing range, Thomas Smith should try to chop down the tree.

The reasoning behind this plan is Thomas' task priorities. The first task is chopping wood and the tree is the only source of wood in visibility range. Even though there are pieces of wood lying around, collecting them does not serve the task of chopping wood. It is also necessary to chop wood before Thomas can store wood in his chest.

[1690322474482]The highest priority task for Thomas Smith is to chop wood. Since his inventory isn't full yet, and he's standing right next to a tree with 50% health, the best action would be to swing his axe to chop more wood. Also, swinging the axe doesn't require moving, saving time.

[1690322491577]Plan: 
[1690322491578]Given the current information, we can see that Thomas Smith's first task is to chop wood, but his inventory is already full of wood. He can't pick up any more wood until he creates some space, thus he needs to tackle his second task of storing wood in the chest. The chest's location is at coordinates X: -5.51, Y: -4.46. The distance isn't provided, but we know he can move from his current location.

Once he has deposited some wood, he can return to chopping more wood. If we consider the environment objects, the closest piece of wood is farthest away at 2.152274m. However, there's a tree stump in his hitbox, which suggests that if he swings his axe, he could chop the stump and obtain more wood without having to move.

When selecting an action, he should prioritize moving towards the chest to deposit some wood before returning to chopping.

[1690322499073]The current tasks are chopping wood, storing wood in a chest, and cooking dinner. Given Thomas's full inventory and proximity to a tree stump, his next best action would be to swing his axe at the tree stump. Although affecting the stump won't produce more wood (his inventory is already full), it will help him with his first task of chopping wood. There isn't enough available data to execute the second and third tasks.

[1690322524336]Plan: 
[1690322524337]Thomas has an inventory that is full, with 9 wood and 1 axe. His tasks include chopping wood, storing the wood in a chest, and cooking dinner. Given that his inventory is full, it would be wise for him to start storing the wood in a chest before he continues chopping wood. Then, he is needs to cook dinner.

Step 1: Thomas should move to the location of the chest [X: -5.51, Y: -4.46]
Step 2: Thomas needs to deposit all the wood he collected into the chest.
Step 3: Thomas can then move to the nearby trees [Locations mentioned above] and start chopping wood again.
Step 4: Storing the chopped wood in the chest again.
Step 5: Finally, Thomas can start cooking dinner.

Reasoning: Since Thomas has a full inventory (10/10), he cannot chop any more wood. Therefore, the initial action in the plan is to move to the chest and store the extra wood making room in his inventory to chop down more wood. After the inventory is clear, Thomas is able to continue chopping wood. Once the inventory is close to full again, he can repeat the process of storing wood in the chest. When all wood chopping tasks are complete, Thomas will finally cook dinner.

The JSON object must be immediately after "Action: " as we're using regex to parse it.

[1690322542908]Plan: 
[1690322542909]Given the tasks and their priority scores, Thomas's highest priority task is to chop the wood. However, he has a full inventory. Therefore, he may need to store his wood in the chest first to create space and then go chop more wood.

[1690322562820]Plan: 
[1690322562820]Thomas has just chopped down some trees and has deposited his gathered wood inside a chest within his vicinity. His highest priority task currently is to chop wood, which he has just completed. His next priority task is to store wood in the chest. However, from his previous actions, it seems he has already stored all of the wood he chopped into the chest. His inventory confirms this as he currently holds no wood, but only his axe. Hence, his next action should be centered around his third-highest priority task: cooking dinner. Unfortunately, we don't have more information about where and what Thomas would cook for dinner, so we would need to assume that Thomas will collect the wood he has chopped and stored inside the chest to use as firewood for cooking. As such, Thomas' next action would be to retrieve some wood from the chest.

Given this plan, we arrive at the JSON object for the action for Thomas Smith to remove wood from the chest: 

Action: {"type": "RemoveItemFromChest", "data": {"characterId": "A1", "chestId": "chest_(-5.51,-4.46)", "itemId": "wood"}}
