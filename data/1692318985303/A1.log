I also plan to find more ways to tighten my grip on power, perhaps through further control of resources or inspiring fear in the villagers. Lastly, I might tell a few more exaggerated tales at the tavern later, to keep up my image.

[1692319189290] [36m[CORTEX] Character 2 - Say: [39mWell, Eli. Our village is nestled in the embrace of majestic forested mountains, teeming with a vibrant variety of wildlife. The Nume River, as swift and relentless as I am, slices through our world, its course a lifeline to both flora and fauna. And did you know, in a certain corner of these woods, wild strawberries grow - they offer a taste of the sweet amidst life's brutal reality. Now, have a look around, Eli - the more you understand, the more you'll survive.
