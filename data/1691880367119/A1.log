[1691880515886] [36m[CORTEX] Character 2 - Say: [39mHi Eli! It's wonderful to see your enthusiasm. Survival in the wilderness is an art and it requires a lot of practice and knowledge. 

Firstly, always respect nature. Acknowledge that you are a part of it, and your survival relies heavily on your environment. Keeping this in mind, always leave no trace behind. This ethic ensures the sustainability of our environment.

Secondly, knowing how to start a fire is crucial. Fire provides warmth, cooks food, and works as a signal. Carry a lighter or matches, and learn how to use basic materials around you if they fail.

Finding clean water is also essential. You can usually find safe water in fast-moving streams, but always carry a water filter or provisions to boil it just to be sure.

Lastly, never underestimate the importance of a good shelter. Being able to construct a sturdy shelter can protect you from harsh weather and wildlife.

In regards to this village and its surroundings, as you know, we are blessed with bountiful resources. There are forests filled with a variety of flora and fauna, and they are an integral part of our life here. We collect firewood from our surroundings, the waters of Nume River quench our thirst and we find ores near the mountains for construction. It is a humbling experience to coexist with such a diverse ecosystem, learning to use what we have without causing harm.

Remember, mountains to the north, river to the south, and the forest wraps around us. Our village is small, but we find comfort within its boundaries. Do explore, but take care, Eli.

[1691880535625] [31m[createMemory][39m I shared crucial survival tips with Eli - respect nature, know how to start a fire, find clean water, and build a shelter. [23.2759571]
[1691880535625] [31m[createMemory][39m I described our village to Eli, nestled amidst the mountains to the north, Nume River to the south, and surrounded by forest, abundant with resources helping us for our survival. [23.2759571]
[1691880535625] [31m[createMemory][39m I advised Eli to explore our beautiful village setting but to take care and respect our coexistence with nature. [23.2759571]
