[1694645494958] [35m[CORTEX] James McAllister - Plan: [39m James plans to move on from the current town to the nearest city. He heard of a bustling market there and is hoping to sell most of his gadgets and trinkets. He will also reach out to an old contact who might have some valuable goods for him to add to his ware. Furthermore, he hopes to gather more stories and news to share in his future travels. He is also planning to teach himself a new magic trick to lighten the mood during his sales talks.
[1694645498562] [35m[CORTEX] James McAllister - Say: [39mHarold, you ever wonder how a man can sell a grand piano from a cart? Well, let me tell you, itâ€™s all about the art of possibility!

[1694645507357] [35m[CORTEX] James McAllister - Prior Message: [39mThat's a curious thought, James. Life's full of surprises, isn't it?

[1694645510544] [35m[CORTEX] James McAllister - Feel: [39mThat's a curious thought, James. Life's full of surprises, isn't it?
[1694645524210] [35m[CORTEX] James McAllister - Explain: [39mYes indeed, life always has an ace up its sleeve, doesn't it? And it does seem like I managed to pique Harold's curiosity. Maybe that's a good starting point to develop the rapport I'm aiming for. Every little interaction counts. Talking about my grand sale might have amused him, but it also showed him that I'm not just a man of words but also a man of action. Next time I meet him, I'll try to involve him more in my tales and tricks. Maybe even teach him one. People do love to learn something new and interesting. However, I should also be wary not to overwhelm him. Some folks are like waters, you have to tread calmly and patiently. Let's see how it goes.
[1694645525102] [35m[CORTEX] James McAllister - Did I make progress? [39m[yes]
[1694645526521] [35m[CORTEX] James McAllister - Did I accomplish my goal? [39m[yes]
[1694645536564] [35m[CORTEX] James McAllister - Explain: [39mLooking at how Harold engaged in the conversation, I believe it's not the time to end it yet. Instead, I think I've found a new conversation goal. Harold seems to enjoy tales of the unusual. Perhaps I can spin a yarn about a peculiar gadget in my cart and see how he reacts. Is he curious? Does it make him laugh? A reaction could give me a glimpse into what he might be interested in buying, and even if he isn't looking to purchase, a good story never goes wasted.
[1694645537475] [35m[CORTEX] James McAllister - Should I end the conversation? [39m[yes]
[1694645540895] [35m[CORTEX] James McAllister Goodbye: [39mHarold, it's been a pleasure as always. Remember, life's a grand piano waiting to be played. See you down the road!
[1694645548296] [31m[createMemory][39m Harold once told me, 'Even a salesman could learn from the sea.' Heâ€™s not wrong. [24.90752]
