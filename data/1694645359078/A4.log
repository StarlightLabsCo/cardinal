[1694645499570] [35m[CORTEX] Lucy Wilde - Plan: [39m With the sun still hiding behind the horizon, Lucy is preparing for a day of hard work. Today, she plans to survey the forest for signs of disease or pests, fell a few old trees that have reached their natural end, and mark new ones for future felling. She will then return to the village to provide timber for various needs, ensure the health of the forest, and share stories with George over the warm glow of a campfire. She might also take young Will for a hands-on tutorial, continuing her legacy and nurturing his enthusiasm for the forest's trade.

[1694645600962] [35m[CORTEX] Lucy Wilde - Plan: [39m Lucy is planning to journey deeper into the forest to mark out the next group of trees that need to be cut for the village's timber needs. She also intends to check on some of the younger trees she's been nurturing, ensuring they're growing well. As a guardian of the forest, part of her responsibility is to ensure there's always a healthy balance. After a long, rewarding day, she'll join the villagers for dinner and share her day's adventures, and perhaps recount a few tales about Whisper, her axe.
[1694645604779] [35m[CORTEX] Lucy Wilde - Say: [39mEli, remember respect is the root of coexistence. Take from the forest what you need but always give back. It's been the core of our survival and harmony.
