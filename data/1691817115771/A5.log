I want to discover new paths and maybe, if I'm lucky enough, interact with some animals. After lunch time, I plan to make a stop at my secret clearing â€“ I have found it last month and it has become my favourite place to think and relax in the wild. I should be back home by supper.

I'm excited for tomorrow's journey and can't wait to share my discoveries with him.
