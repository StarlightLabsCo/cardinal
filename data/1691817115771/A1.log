I will also make sure someone else in the village knows about this exploration as a safety precaution, in case anything unexpected happens. I'll check on Eli when he returns to ensure everything went well.
[1691817766932] [36m[CORTEX] Character 2 - Say: [39mThat sounds like a great plan, Eli. But remember, the forest can be unpredictable sometimes, so take all necessary precautions. Let someone else in the village know about your plan as well. Also, remember our forest safety rules - stay on the paths, avoid any unknown fruits or plants, and keep a distance from wild animals. I look forward to hearing about your discoveries. Safe travels, Eli.
