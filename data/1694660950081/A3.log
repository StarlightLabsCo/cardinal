He plans to show the newcomer around town meeting the friendly locals, perhaps introducing them to George and Thomas. He also plans to tell them about the beautiful sites he's discovered within the mines, only to inspire the newcomer with the village's treasures and mysteries.
[1694661307340] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Say: [39mAbsolutely, I can guide you to Nume Village. Follow me!

[1694661317538] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Prior Message: [39mGreat, thanks!
[1694661317539] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Patience: [39m100
[1694661317539] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Conversation Goal: [39mFigure out why Thomas Smith started a conversation with me.
[1694661317539] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Conversation Finished: [39mfalse
[1694661320594] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Feel: [39mI feel happy to help the newcomer navigate to Nume Village.
[1694661331386] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Explain: [39mThomas Smith approached me and started a conversation, asking for directions to Nume Village. I agreed to guide him there, which made me feel appreciated and useful. This encounter allowed me to engage in conversation with a fellow villager, which I believe is integral to my goal of becoming a full part of this mining community. Thus, I feel I have made significant progress in my goal through this interaction.
[1694661332469] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Did I make progress? [39m[yes]
[1694661334172] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Did I accomplish my goal? [39m[yes]
[1694661341134] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Explain: [39mNow that I've helped the newcomer with directions, I think it might be a good idea to end our conversation here. However, part of me also wants to learn more about his reasons for coming to the village. Is he interested in mining too? Or perhaps he has a different story to share. I think my new conversation goal would be to understand more about him.
[1694661342809] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Should I end the conversation? [39m[yes]
[1694661346730] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner Goodbye: [39mIt was good to meet you and I'm glad I could help! If you need anything else in Nume Village, don't hesitate to ask. Safe travels!
[1694661359952] [31m[createMemory][39m The first time I stepped into the mines, I was captivated by the echoic sounds that filled the darkness, the enigma of the craggy walls under the lantern light. [70.42846]
[1694661359953] [31m[createMemory][39m George and Thomas have been my mentors as I fumble through the different mine routes, startled by the clatter of mine carts. [70.42846]
[1694661359953] [31m[createMemory][39m The time I broke my pickaxe on the first day, but I didn't let that deter me from envisioning the day I will unearth a rare gem. [70.42846]
[1694661359953] [31m[createMemory][39m The day I guided the newcomer to Nume Village, feeling an increased sense of unity with the community. [70.42846]
