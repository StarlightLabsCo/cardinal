[1693034524854] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Explain: [39mThomas has mentioned that he was at the mines and is now heading back to the village. This information doesn't particularly give me any insight into why he started this conversation, as his activities seem typical for his day-to-day routine. I will continue the conversation, hopefully unveiling his intentions as we go along.

Also, I'm intrigued about his mine visit and plan to ask him about it. After the chat, I'll set off fulfilling my plans for the day in the forest.
[1693034536332] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Say: [39mI've got my sights set on the eastern woods, always new things to discover there! How were the mines, by the way? Find any interesting minerals?

[1693034568977] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Explain: [39mThomas has shared some valuable information about the discovery of diamond ore in the mines, but it has not brought me closer to figuring out why he initiated this conversation with me. Therefore, I still haven't made much progress towards my goal.
