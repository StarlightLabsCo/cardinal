[1694663884101] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Plan: [39m Will plans to guide Thomas to Nume Village while sharing stories about his experiences in the mine and learning from Thomas's experiences
[1694663887917] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Say: [39mHi there, Thomas! Yeah, Nume Village is not too far from here. I can direct you. By the way, I'm Will. Nice to meet you!

[1694663913975] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Prior Message: [39mNice to meet you Will! Would you be willing to guide me there? I get lost easily so having someone with me would really help.

[1694663917579] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Feel: [39mI feel responsible that Thomas needs my help to find Nume Village, and I am willing to assist him.
[1694663930228] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Explain: [39mThomas's request to guide him to the Nume Village made me feel responsible. Here was the first real test of my knowledge about the pathways in the mine. This event marked a significant progress towards my goal of figuring out why Thomas started a conversation with me. If successful, not only would I have played a vital role in helping Thomas, but I also would have gained further confidence navigating the mine. I realized that this was an opportunity to bond with an experienced miner, glean knowledge, and thereby inch closer to emulating my father's prowess that I admired so much. Therefore, agreeing to guide Thomas became a necessary step in my larger learning curve.
[1694663931261] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Did I make progress? [39m[yes]
[1694663933067] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Did I accomplish my goal? [39m[yes]
[1694663941201] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Explain: [39mThomas' lost and confused state reminds me of my own initial days in the mines. His humble request resonates with me and, without hesitation, I decide to guide him to Nume Village. After all, it's a small detour from my route and a great opportunity to prove my knowledge of the area. Besides, this experience could help me learn more about dealing with unexpected situations, a skill that is invaluable in the mining world.
[1694663942278] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Should I end the conversation? [39m[yes]
[1694663948084] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner Goodbye: [39mAbsolutely, Thomas! I'd be glad to guide you to Nume Village. Don't worry about getting lost — we're all here for each other.
