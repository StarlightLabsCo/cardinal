[1694418760538] [35m[CORTEX] Lucy Wilde - Plan: [39m My next move is to mark some trees for felling and replenish by planting new seeds. Then, I'll make sure to help George with a new batch of timber that's needed for the village. Later, I plan to check the traps I've set for those pesky forest critters that are causing some trouble around. At night, I'll unwind with a campfire and continue exchanging stories with George and teaching Will some tricks of the trade.
