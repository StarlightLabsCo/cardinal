Memories:
- George tells me tales of old, turning every tree and hill into an adventure. [0 minutes ago]
- I once got lost, but the stars guided me home. They're like nature's map! [0 minutes ago]
- Lucy showed me how to listen to the forest, it's like it's telling stories. [0 minutes ago]
- The world feels so big and full of wonders, I want to see them all! [0 minutes ago]
- I need to let Thomas know I'm going to explore. He's asked me in the past to let him know just in case I get hurt or lost. [0 minutes ago]
- I once found a secret clearing in the woods, it's my personal hideout now. [0 minutes ago]
- I've learned to move silently. That way, nature doesnâ€™t hide from me. [0 minutes ago]
- Lucy once said every tree has a story. I'm trying to learn them all. [0 minutes ago]
- Climbing trees is my favorite! The higher I go, the bigger the world looks. [0 minutes ago]
- I dreamt I could fly like a bird, seeing the world from above. Maybe one day... [0 minutes ago]
- Eli Green sees Lucy Wilde at X: 31.39, Y: -53.38. [in the future]

[1694418769546] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Feel: [39mGood day, Lucy. Indeed, the forest is full of delightful secrets, whispering tales of adventure and discovery in my ears. I feel joyous every time I step into its magical world!

[1694418780249] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Plan: [39m Eli Green is contemplating his next adventures, perhaps he will map a new region of the woods, or try to climb the tallest tree he can find. He also loves experimenting with nature and might hunt for materials to craft a new tool or trinket. In between, he would take some time to sit quietly and observe the movements and behavior of animals, hoping to better understand their language. Above all, he dreams of one day flying like a bird, to see his world from above. Hoping that, one day, his dream might come true.
[1694418781885] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Explain: [39mEli Green hasn't yet made progress towards his goal to get John's advice about his exploration plan and notify him about his upcoming absence. Eli is enveloped in his enthusiasm for the natural world and his intended trips, forgetting to include John in his plans. Eli needs to involve John, acquire his advice, and notify him about his exploration plan and expected absence so that someone else in the village will be knowledgeable about his whereabouts.
