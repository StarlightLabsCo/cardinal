[1693635789259] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Plan: [39m Eli is planning his next adventure. He intends to explore a nearby ridge he recently spotted. It's higher than any place he's been before, and he believes it will offer a breathtaking view of the surrounding forest. He's also hoping to find new plant species or perhaps another secret clearing. After that, he wants to practice his reed-whistle and see if he can communicate with the birds. As always, Eli is looking forward to whatever surprises nature might have in store for him.
