I found a beautiful red feather that must have fallen from a northern cardinal, and a set of tiny animal tracks that led me to a family of rabbits. As for Thomas Smith, I am still not sure why he started a conversation with me. But his interest in my adventures makes me think that he shares my curiosity about the world, and perhaps he even has his own stories of the forest to tell. I look forward to delving deeper into this newfound bond with Thomas and learning what he has to share.
