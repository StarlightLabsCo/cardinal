[1695447408821] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Prior Message: [39mHey there! I'm looking to chop some wood myself. Do you by any chance have a spare axe?
[1695447408821] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Patience: [39m100
[1695447408821] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Conversation Goal: [39mFigure out why Thomas Smith started a conversation with me.
[1695447408821] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Conversation Finished: [39mfalse
[1695447412620] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Feel: [39mI'm sorry, but I don't usually carry an axe with me. I'm more of an observer than a lumberjack. But I bet George might be able to help you out.
[1695447415410] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Plan: [39m Eli plans to direct Thomas Smith to George as a potential source of an axe for chopping wood. He also intends to explore further into the woods.
[1695447417608] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Say: [39mSorry Thomas, I don't have an axe. But you could ask George, he might have one.
