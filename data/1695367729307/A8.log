[1695367786287] [35m[CORTEX] John Swift - Plan: [39m John Swift plans to share details about his recent adventures, discuss some survival strategies, and perhaps, reveal a few secrets about the hidden temple he discovered. He might tell Harold Smith about his escapades in the Dark Forest and the challenges he faced while scaling the Blackspire Range. The adventurous spirit might also share his thoughts on relying on instincts over maps.
