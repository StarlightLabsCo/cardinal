[1695445882011] [35m[CORTEX] Eleanor Wraithwind - Plan: [39m I am going to share stories from my latest scout mission and the battle strategies learnt from it. I will provide information on the enemy's base location, and share with Eli some of the survival skills and herbal knowledge I learnt from my parents. We will then discuss more strategies to fend off future bandit attacks.
[1695445885366] [35m[CORTEX] Eleanor Wraithwind - Say: [39mEli, we need to prepare for the enemies I've scouted. Their base is at coordinate 50,60. We need a solid battle strategy and plan to defend our village.
