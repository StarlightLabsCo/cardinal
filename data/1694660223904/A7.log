[1694660640757] [35m[CORTEX] Harold Smith - Explain: [39mJames asked me where he can find a fishing rod. It seems he might be interested in fishing. Could it be he initiated the conversation to get some advice on it? I should offer him some guidance on where to find a good fishing rod, perhaps that helps me learn more about his intentions.

[1694660718564] [35m[CORTEX] Harold Smith - Explain: [39mGiving directions to my old storage shed is not as straightforward as I initially thought. Nume Village, after all, has got its fair share of houses and sheds. And given the network of small roads and similar-looking houses, it won't be an easy task for James, who's apparently new to this place. I should provide more detailed pointers like landmarks or more specific routes so as to not complicate things for him.
