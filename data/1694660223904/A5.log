[1694660713281] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Plan: [39m Eli is planning to create a map of the village and its surroundings to document all his explorations. He intends to include every tree, clearing, and hidden path heâ€™s discovered so far. Besides, he's going to spend time learning animal sounds in an attempt to communicate with his non-human friends.
[1694660716258] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Say: [39mHi Thomas, let's play a game. Imagine you're an explorer too - what would be the first thing you'd explore?

[1694660753995] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Should I end the conversation? [39m[yes]
[1694660757448] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green Goodbye: [39mThomas, we'll have to explore those mountains together soon. Until then, keep dreaming and exploring. See you around, friend!
