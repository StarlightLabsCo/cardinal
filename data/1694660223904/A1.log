[1694660729953] [35m[CORTEX] Thomas Smith - Plan: [39m In this imaginative scenario, the first thing Thomas Smith would explore would be the dense, forested mountains that surround the village. He'd be particularly interested in the wildlife and unique terrain that these mountains have to offer. He knows that these terrains hold valuable resources and understanding them better will strengthen his power over the villagers. He would wake up early, organize a small exploration team and set out at the break of dawn.
