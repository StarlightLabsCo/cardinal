[1691730563180] [36m[CORTEX] Character 2 - Say: [39mOf course, Eli. The key to efficient mining is being able to identify the best spots for digging. Look out for areas where the coal is naturally exposed. Use your pickaxe at an angle, this will help in breaking the rock and separating the coal. Most importantly, always be aware of your surroundings while mining, safety should always be the primary concern. Don't dig straight down or up to prevent any accidents and always have a clear exit pathway.
