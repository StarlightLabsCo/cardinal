He intends to manipulate Eli, sending him deep into the woods while he subtly furthers his control over the village. He probably makes sure to wake up before 7am to get a head start on his actions. His plans also involve leveraging his control over the locations around the village, such as the Nume River, making it instrumental in his power game. Meanwhile, he uses seemingly innocuous personal details, like his fondness for strawberries, to present himself as harmless and relatable to the villagers.
