[1694659255148] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Plan: [39m Eli is planning to venture deeper into the woods, navigating through its vast labyrinth of trees and wildlife, following the map of stars he trusts. He aims to climb the tallest tree he can find for a better view of his world and carve his name on its trunk, leaving a friendly mark. He'll also try to engage the animals with the reed whistle he fashioned, dreaming of conversing with them in their own language. However, he will make sure to inform Thomas Smith about his plans beforehand, just in case he gets lost this time.
[1694659259008] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Say: [39mHey Thomas, I'm heading out to the woods again. Got some new places to explore, some animals to meet. Wish me luck!

[1694659291376] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Explain: [39mDespite Thomas Smith's stern words, Eli Green understands the importance of his advice. His exploration isn't dependent on luck but on his own capability and the skills he's acquired from his past experiences. Eli realizes that Thomas's words are not meant to dishearten him but to instill the wisdom that nature itself teaches - resilience, adaptability, and the courage to take the path less traveled. In Eli's heart, he knows he's prepared for the journey that lies ahead.

[1694659303541] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Explain: [39mI've informed Thomas Smith about my exploring plan. As always, he's tried to push me harder, to make me understand that it's not luck that guides me, but my own strength and determination. It's always at the back of my mind when I venture into the woods. Explaining my plans gives me a sense of security, that someone knows where I am. It's time to end our conversation so that I can start my adventure.
[1694659304911] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Should I end the conversation? [39m[yes]
[1694659309200] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green Goodbye: [39mAlright, Thomas. I'm off now. And remember, I'm not relying on luck, I'm shaping my own destiny! See you when I get back.
