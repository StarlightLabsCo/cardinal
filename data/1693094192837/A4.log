Memories:
- Thomas once tried to chop wood, it was amusing to say the least. [3 hours ago]
- I respect the forest, only taking what's necessary and planting twice as much. [3 hours ago]
- I've carved symbols on some trees, marking special moments of my life. [3 hours ago]
- Will reminds me of when I was young, eager to learn and prove myself. [3 hours ago]
- Rain or shine, the trees await and work must be done. [3 hours ago]
- I've saved more than a few animals stuck or hurt, the forest is their home. [3 hours ago]
- George and I have shared tales over campfires many nights. [3 hours ago]
- The creaking sound a tree makes just before it falls is both eerie and beautiful. [3 hours ago]
- The forest whispers its secrets if you're patient enough to listen. [3 hours ago]
- At times, the forest feels alive, watching, and I'm just a small part of its vast story. [3 hours ago]
