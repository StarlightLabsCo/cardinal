[1690323329212]Plan: 
[1690323329213]Given the tasks and environment, Thomas' first task should be to chop wood. The closest tree is within his hitbox, thus he can proceed with the task without needing to move. Following this, he can store the wood in the chest, which is around 7.321983m away. He will then need to cook dinner. Given the current available actions we don't have any specific actions related to cooking dinner, but perhaps after accomplishing task 2 (storing wood), subsequent available actions may appear.

Now, to perform the action of chopping wood:

This should be executed through the [SwingAxe] action from the available actions, since Thomas already has an Axe in his inventory and there is a Tree (with 10/10 health) in his hitbox. This action does not depend on the 'MoveTo' action, so he doesn't need to change his location. 

Additionally, the [SwingAxe] action doesn't require the 'itemId' parameter, since Thomas only has one item in his inventory, which is the Axe, it's obvious that he will be using it for swinging. 

Given this information, the JSON object for performing the first task will be: 

Action: {"type": "SwingAxe", "data": {"characterId": "A1"}}
[1690323329214]--- Verified Action ---
[1690323329214]{

[1690323338572]Plan: 
[1690323338572]Considering his tasks and environment, Thomas Smith should continue chopping the tree around him to fulfill his first priority task, which is to chop wood. As per his available actions list, he doesn't need to move or change since an action, [SwingAxe], is available. So he should swing his axe to chop the tree.

[1690323352495]Plan: 
[1690323352496]Given the tasks at hand and current location of Thomas Smith, the plan will be to first chop the nearest tree/trees until we gather 10 pieces of wood (Including the one that we currently possess). We will then travel to the chest to store the gathered wood and then find a suitable spot to cook dinner. To work towards the first step of our plan, we need to select a tree that is at the least distance from us. Currently, the nearest tree is at X: -0.6865366, Y: -1.433641.

[1690323377496]Plan: 
[1690323377496]The primary task is to chop wood. Thomas is currently in proximity to chop a tree with 5/10 health. Considering his braver nature, he should not fear about getting hurt from falling trees. He can continue chopping down the tree by swinging the axe. After reducing the tree to a stump, he can collect the chopped wood and add it to his inventory. Post that, he can focus on the second task, which is to store the collected wood in the chest. Since the chest is at a distance of 5.851455m, he will have to move to the chest's location to deposit the wood.

[1690323388620]Plan: 
[1690323388620]Considering the current tasks, Thomas needs to chop wood first. Given that he's already next to a tree stump, the best action would be to swing his axe at it. After he has gathered enough wood, he'd need to move to where the chest is to store the wood. Following that, the next task would be to cook dinner, but details are lacking on accomplishing this task.

[1690323404908]Plan: 
[1690323404908]1. Thomas Smith's first priority is to chop wood. He has already chopped down at least three trees and collected three woods in the process, as indicated in his inventory. 
2. He is currently at location: -0.5449716, -1.363549, which is close to a tree stump, but he may proceed to a full-health tree.
3. The nearest full-health tree from Thomas Smith's location has the coordinates [X: 0.86, Y: -2.57, Distance: 1.851883m], so he should walk to this tree and chop it down using his axe. 
4. After chopping down a tree, he should retrieve the wood and continue to repeat the process until he has the wood he needs or his axe breaks.

[1690323419445]Plan: 
[1690323419445]1. Thomas needs to chop more wood as part of his first task.
2. He is currently near two trees, he can choose to chop the nearby trees.
3. After chopping the wood, Thomas should pick up the chopped wood and add it to his inventory.
4. Once he has enough wood, he should store it in a chest.
5. After this, Thomas can focus on his task of cooking dinner.

Reasoning: Since Thomas is a lumberjack and his first task is to chop wood, it is logical that he should first focus on this task - in this case, by chopping nearby trees. After this, he can continue with the rest of his tasks in order. If an item needs to be picked up or dropped, actions are available for that as well. Therefore, my first action would be to chop more wood, as he's lovingly positioned near two healthy trees.

[1690323443829]Plan: 
[1690323443829]Thomas Smith's task is to chop wood, store the wood in the chest and then cook dinner. To accomplish these tasks, here are the steps:
1. Continue chopping wood from the tree stumps until inventory is full.
2. Once inventory is full, walk towards chest and store the wood.
3. Finally, return back to his habitat and start cooking dinner. 

However, Task-1 "Chop wood" takes priority according to the 'priority' field in Tasks array. Thomas is already positioned at a location with two tree stumps so he can swing his axe to chop these trees.

This can be represented in the JSON action as follows,

[1690323461385]Plan: 
[1690323461385]Since the priority one task is to chop wood, Thomas is already at a location where there are trees around, and he has an axe in his inventory, hence he should use the axe to chop nearest tree. We see from the last SwingAxe action, Thomas hit 2 trees, implies two trees are in range for chopping. Capacity of woods in inventory is 4 before they reach the limit of 10.

Reasoning:
Thomas is already at location where trees are present nearby. There's a tree at (X: -0.42, Y: -3.52), (X: 1.22, Y: -4.18), and (X: 2.38, Y: -3.11) which are close to him. By prioritizing the tasks of chopping the wood and comparing them with the previous tasks, swing axe action should be repeated. Inventory has enough space for more wood as there are total of 6 out of 10 items in the inventory currently.

[1690323480430]Plan: 
[1690323480431]The character Thomas Smith is in a virtual environment surrounded by trees and wood. He's a lumberjack and his tasks reflect his profession. He is tasked with chopping wood, storing the wood in the chest, and preparing dinner. He should focus on chop the wood corresponding to his priority task. After he gathers more wood, he would move to the chest and drop the wood there. Only after he completes these two tasks, he should start cooking. 
Given the character's current status from the 'Environment' field, he is surrounded by more trees that are at a reasonable distance from him. The closest tree is at the coordinates X: -0.42, Y: -3.52 with a distance of 1.539674m. So he should move to this tree and start chopping.

[1690323496352]Plan: 
[1690323496352]Since the first priority task is to "Chop wood" and Thomas is currently right beside a tree with full health, the best course of action is to swing his axe and chop the tree. This would serve to reduce the health of the tree, generate chopped wood, and fulfill the task. Once the tree is down to zero health and no other trees are within range, he should move towards the next closest tree and repeat the process.

After gathering wood, it would then be a priority to store the wood in the chest, fulfilling priority task 2. This can be done by moving towards the chest and depositing the wood.

Following this, as his last priority task is to cook a meal, he would need to gather materials to build a fire - additional wood gathered can serve this purpose. He can then use these materials to build the fire and cook dinner.

[1690323508031]Plan: 
[1690323508031]First, Thomas Smith should continue chopping the nearest tree (health 5/10) to gather more wood, since the "Chop wood" task has the highest priority. Once the capacity limit of the inventory is reached, Thomas should move to the chest's location to store the wood for the "Store wood in chest" task. Time permitting, Thomas can then begin the low-priority task of cooking dinner.

Action to be executed now: Continue chopping the nearest tree

[1690323519078]Plan: 
[1690323519078]Reasoning:

Since Thomas Smith's most prioritized task is to chop wood and he already has an Axe in his inventory, the best course of action is to chop the nearest Tree or Tree Stump. The Hitbox section indicates that a Tree Stump is currently within hitting distance, so it would be best to swing at the Tree Stump.

[1690323533301]Plan: 
[1690323533301]The first priority task is to chop wood. Looking at the environment, there are several healthy trees in relatively close proximity, with Tree located at coordinates [X: 1.22, Y: -4.18] being the closest. It's reasonable, thus, to move Thomas Smith to this tree and chop it down using the axe in his inventory. After acquiring enough wood (maxing out his inventory), he should move towards the chest located at [X: -5.51, Y: -4.46] to store the wood, as per his second priority task. With these two tasks accomplished, he can later work on his third priority task of cooking dinner.

Given the available information, pick the best available action to accomplish your tasks. Respond in JSON: { type: [ActionType], data: {characterId optional parameters}}. Please note that if an action is in the available items list, you can execute it immediately, without needing to change or move. First you should list your reasoning and create a plan, and then using that plan, select an action and create a JSON object for that action with the necessary info. The JSON object must be immediately after "Action: " as we're using regex to parse it.

[1690323555834]Plan: 
[1690323555834]The primary task for Thomas Smith is to chop wood. This is his immediate main priority. Looking at the location and environment data, there happen to be multiple trees nearby that he can chop, with the nearest being at 0.1631235m from him. Given that his axe is currently in his inventory, he doesn't need to fetch it.

He also needs to store the wood in a chest afterward, though this task has a lower priority. Looking at the given data, the nearest chest is 6.609107m away.

Finally, he needs to cook dinner. However, there is no actionable data relating to this task in the information provided.

Reasoning:

Since chopping wood is his most immediate task and he is already quite near a tree, there is no need to move. He can execute the SwingAxe action to chop the nearest tree. This will immediately contribute towards completing his first task. After chopping the wood, he will need to collect it (presumably), though there is no explicit task for this in the data given.

[1690323580310]Plan: 
[1690323580310]Thomas Smith's main task is to chop wood, after which he needs to store his collected wood in a chest, and finally, cook dinner. It appears Thomas has already located trees in his vicinity and can start chopping the one that's closest (since he was able to hit 2 trees on his last swing). This will help him accomplish his first task of chopping wood, enabling him to proceed to the next task.

To achieve this, Thomas should use his axe to chop the trees, but we also need to remember that he can only carry two more pieces of wood in his inventory. Depending on the outcome, he may need to make a trip to the chest for unloading before continuing to chop down trees.

For his second task, Thomas will need to locate the chest with his wood items. Although he currently doesn't see the chest, it exists in his memories. Hence, he may need to move towards its last known coordinates. 

For cooking dinner, it's dependent on other steps creating the context (presumably the acquisition of food items, perhaps as rewards from chest).

Action: 

The best option now is to swing the axe to chop down the trees. The JSON command would be:

"type": "SwingAxe",

"characterId": "A1" 
}

[1690323591892]Plan: 
[1690323591892]As per Thomas's occupation and looking at his tasks, Thomas should firstly work on his task of chopping wood. He has an axe in his inventory and a tree stump in his hitbox, so he can swing his axe immediately. After chopping the wood, depending upon the space left in his inventory, Thomas can pick up the wood and then move towards the chest to complete his second task of storing the wood in the chest. After these tasks are done, Thomas can proceed to his final task of cooking dinner.

[1690323607042]Plan: 
[1690323607043]The primary task for Thomas Smith is to chop wood. Since Thomas has already completely filled his inventory with 9 pieces of wood and has only one axe, that means he cannot carry any more wood. Therefore, the logical next step for him would be to store the wood in the chest that is around 6.6m away. After storing him, he can continue with chopping more wood. Cooking dinner is the last priority.

[1690323624240]Plan: 
[1690323624240]Considering the given data, the fact that Thomas Smith's inventory is full, and the priority of his tasks, Thomas should carry out the second task i.e., "Store wood in chest". For this, he does not need to move to any specific location as he is already within the hit range of the chest as evident from the Hitbox data "Chest (Health: 10/10)". Thus he can directly place the wood in the chest.

[1690323642256]Plan: 
[1690323642256]Based on the information given and the tasks, the main priorities for Thomas Smith are "Chop wood" and "Store wood in chest". He has already stored some wood in the chest. The closest tree is at a distance of 4.996482m. Since Thomas's inventory is almost full (9/10), he can handle chopping one more tree before he needs to store the wood in the chest. The trees have a health of 10/10, and previous actions show that swinging the axe may hit multiple trees but it doesn't guarantee that the tree’s health would be reduced to 0 in one swing. 

Plan:
1) Move to the closest tree.
2) Swing the axe to chop down the tree. This may require multiple actions based on the tree's health.
3) Pick up the wood (if inventory permits).
4) If inventory is full or no more trees close by, move to the chest and store the wood.

Execution:
Start by moving to the location of the closest tree at coordinates X: -0.48, Y: -5.31.

[1690323662306]Plan: 
[1690323662306]1. Since Thomas's priority task is to chop wood and he already has an axe, he should proceed to chop down a tree.
2. The closest tree is at coordinates X: -0.48, Y: -5.31, and it's within reach, given that his current position is X: -0.6118569, Y: -5.256341.
3. After he finishes chopping the tree, he will have more wood in his inventory to complete his second task, which is to store wood in the chest. The chest is at a location X: -5.51, Y: -4.46, and he will have to walk there.
4. The final task is to cook dinner, for this, more specific actions would be needed, which aren't provided in the current information set.

[1690323674826]Plan: 
[1690323674826]1. Since Thomas Smith's main task is to chop wood, and his hitbox shows that he can hit two trees (each with a health of 5/10), he should swing his axe to chop them down.
2. After collecting the wood, Thomas should take his wood to the nearest Chest at X: -5.51, Y: -4.46.
3. Once he has stored his wood, he can proceed to complete his task of cooking dinner.

[1690323688361]Plan: 
[1690323688361]Thomas Smith has a full inventory and cannot carry additional wood. Therefore, the priority is to drop off the wood at the chest. Smith will then return to chop a tree, gather the resulting wood, drop off the wood at the chest, and finally cook dinner.

Reasoning:

The task "Chop wood" has a higher priority than "Store wood in chest" but Smith's inventory is full. Smith must drop off the wood at the chest before chopping more wood. Additionally, the chest is closer than any trees that could be chopped down.

[1690323707907]Plan: 
[1690323707907]Thomas's inventory is completely full with 9 pieces of wood and an axe, and he's currently closest to a chest. Thus, the ideal first step is to empty out the inventory so Thomas can continue his tasks. This will free up space for more wood to be chopped and collected, as per the first priority task. Upon emptying the inventory, Thomas can then proceed towards the closest tree stump or tree to chop more wood. 

Hence, the best immediate action for Thomas is to deposit his collected wood into the nearby chest. After this action, he can then plan his route to the closest tree stump or tree and continue his first priority task of chopping wood.

[1690323718877]Plan: 
[1690323718878]Looking at Thomas' tasks, the first priority is to chop wood. However, his inventory is at 9/10, so he can't collect more wood. So, he would first need to store the wood he already has in the chest which is nearby. After storing the wood, he can proceed with the 'Chop wood' task.

[1690323729947]Plan: 
[1690323729947]Since Thomas Smith's current task is to chop wood, he should move towards the tree or the tree stump which is closest to him and then swing the axe on it to get more wood. The closest tree or tree stump to him is Tree Stump at X: -0.48, Y: -5.31, but his current hitbox only includes a chest, so he cannot swing on any tree right now. He needs to move closer to the tree stump.

[1690323749068]Plan: 
[1690323749069]Since the current task with the highest priority is to "Chop wood", the character should continue chopping wood. The character is currently next to two tree stumps, both in good health (5/5). Thus, the character could swing his axe at one of these stumps. 

After chopping enough wood, the character can move on to the second task, which is to store the wood in a chest. This will require moving to the chest's location (-5.51, -4.46), picking up the wood, and storing it. 

The last task is to cook dinner. However, there are no available actions related to this task at the moment. The character will likely need to gather additional materials before this task can be undertaken.

Reasoning:
The character is close to two tree stumps, and the character's top priority is to chop wood. The sensible action is to use the SwingAxe action to chop wood from one of the nearby tree stumps. There doesn't appear to be any immediate threat or need to relocate, so the character can focus on chopping the wood.

[1690323768624]Plan: 
[1690323768624]Given that Thomas Smith's primary task is to chop wood which he has been doing successfully, he currently has 8 pieces of wood in his inventory, with a capacity of 10. Rather than dropping any wood, he should continue to chop until capacity is reached, then move to the chest (-5.51, -4.46) and store the wood. Time allowing, he can then action his lower priority task to cook dinner. 

Thomas Smith is already next to two stumps (health 5/5), so he does not need to move anywhere else to continue chopping wood. He should therefore remain at his current location (-0.6079173, -5.259927) and action [SwingAxe]. 

Please note the potential need to [MoveTo] the chest, and [AddItemToChest] once his inventory is full. Also note the very low priority action of [DropItem] - this should only be considered if his inventory becomes unexpectedly full with a more important item or during some other emergency situation. 

Thomas demonstrated good efficiency in previous actions, by moving to the chest only once his inventory was full, thus minimizing back-and-forth between chopping wood and storing it away.

[1690323783352]Plan: 
[1690323783352]Thomas Smith is a lumberjack who mainly has two tasks which are of high priority: "Chop wood" and "Store wood in chest". Thomas has an inventory full of wood and an Axe. And given the memories, we can see that he has been chopping wood and storing it in a chest. 

Thomas's immediate task is to "chop wood", but his inventory is full. So he first needs to store the wood in the chest to free up space. Next, he can continue chopping wood.

Based on the above plan, we need to direct Thomas to move towards the chest to deposit the wood.

The Action will be:
Move Thomas to the chest at X:-5.51, Y:-4.46.

[1690323791244]Begin by chopping the nearest tree due to the high priority of the "Chop wood" task. This can be done until the inventory is full or the axe breaks. After chopping trees, the character should head to the nearest chest to store the collected wood. This helps in freeing up the inventory for more tasks. After storing the wood, the character can then proceed with the task of cooking dinner. 

For now, the best action would be to chop the nearest tree.

[1690323805178]Plan: 
[1690323805178]Thomas Smith's main task is to chop wood and store them in the chest. Currently, Thomas has a full inventory of wood, therefore first he needs to go to the chest and unload his woods in the Inventory. After that, he should pick up the other woods near him and put them in the chest too. This would help Thomas to finish his first and second priority tasks. Once all the woods in the vicinity are cleared, Thomas can swing his axe on the available trees to get more wood. So, for now, the task at hand is to move to the chest and drop the wood.

Reasoning:
Given his current location, the nearest chest is at X: -5.51, Y: -4.46 and he should head towards it. This action aligns with his priorities: Task 1 ("Chop wood") and Task 2 ("Store wood in chest"). He can return to the forest to chop more wood (Task 1) only after he has enough space in his inventory.

[1690323829044]Plan: 
[1690323829044]The first task is to chop wood. As Thomas is currently at the chest and there are no trees around, he would need to move to the location of a tree to begin chopping. Before moving to a tree, however, he should clear some space in his inventory to store the wood he will gather. Currently, he has 1 axe and 9 woods in his inventory which is already full, so he will need to store some of the existing wood in the chest so he can chop more wood. After storing the wood in the chest, we can proceed with moving towards the tree with the least distance, which is at X: 2.72, Y: -5.11 for chopping. If the inventory gets full during chopping, we can visit the chest again to deposit before proceeding to the next task. The second task is to store wood in the chest, we will be continuously storing wood in the chest while chopping if the inventory gets full. The third task is to cook dinner, but currently, as we have no actions available regarding cooking, it cannot be done now.

Action: 
- Firstly, we would move the wood into the chest using the [AddItemToChest] action.

[1690323847846]Plan: 
[1690323847847]The first task in priority is to "Chop wood". As per the Hitbox information, swinging the axe wouldn't hit any trees, only a chest. This means that Thomas would need to move to a location near a tree before swinging his axe. The nearest tree is located at X: 2.72, Y: -5.11 with a distance of 8.13m.
   
After chopping wood, the next task is to store the wood in the chest. Thomas would then need to move to the chest's location at X: -5.51, Y: -4.46, and perform an "AddItemToChest" action.

The final task, "Cook dinner", lacks enough context information. However, assuming there is a fireplace at the chest's location - where Thomas could also ideally find food in the chest - the same "MoveTo" action would set him on course for this task after depositing the wood.

Given the available information, pick the best available action to accomplish your tasks. Respond in JSON: { type: [ActionType], data: {characterId optional parameters}}. Please note that if an action is in the available items list, you can execute it immediately, without needing to change or move. First you should list your reasoning and create a plan, and then using that plan, select an action and create a JSON object for that action with the necessary info. The JSON object must be immediately after "Action: " as we're using regex to parse it.

[1690323867541]Plan: 
[1690323867541]Considering the current environment, tasks, available options and priority, it would be the best decision to start chopping wood, since Thomas's inventory has still free space, and he is already close to a tree. Afterwards, moving to the chest to store the wood would be the next logical step. 

Each unit of Wood in the environment is currently too far for Thomas to interact with immediately, and the distances are all greater than the distance to the closest Tree, which makes chopping wood more time efficient rather than just picking up Wood from the ground.

Cooking a dinner task has the least priority, so we will have to get back to it later after the chopping and storing the wood tasks get finished.

[1690323882084]Plan: 
[1690323882084]Since the first task is to chop wood, and one half-health tree is within the hitbox, the best action would be to swing the axe at the tree. This would hopefully create more wood to fill the inventory. After the wood has been chopped, Thomas Smith can move to the chest location to deposit the wood, fulfilling the second task. The third task, cooking dinner, doesn't have an associated action yet, so it may not be possible at this moment.

[1690323896840]Plan: 
[1690323896840]Thomas Smith's tasks in priority are: Chop wood, Store wood in chest, and Cook dinner. However, his inventory is already full with 9 Wood items and an Axe. The nearest wood inventory (Chest) is 8.12m away. As Smith has enough wood already, the best thing to do now is to fulfill the next priority task, which is "Store wood in chest". He can take the wood from his inventory and store it in the nearest chest (X: -5.51, Y: -4.46). Thus, Thomas would need to move to the chest's coordinates and execute the task.

Action: 

The JSON object for that would be:

[1690323925267]Plan: 
[1690323925268]Since Thomas's highest priority task is to chop wood, he should find the nearest source of wood and chop it by swinging his axe. Because his inventory is full, before storing any new wood, he will need to remove some from his inventory and store it in the nearest chest. Once this is done and while still in close proximity to the wood, he can once more gather it by swinging his axe. 

As per availability of tasks, the object that is the nearest and available to hit is "Chest". But interacting with the chest doesn't contribute to the completion of Thomas's first high-priority task which is to "Chop Wood".

It would instead be more beneficial to move close to the nearest Wood and execute the Swing Axe action, but the closest Wood sources are far from Thomas's current location. The cost of moving, chopping the wood, and then returning to the chest to store it would consume a lot of time.

The chest in proximity has 10/10 health which means it's already full and can't hold more wood.  Therefore, chopping more wood would still be inefficient as Thomas has no place to store it.  

Therefore, with of this in mind, the most logical option for Thomas to accomplish his current task list is to complete the second priority task before he can proceed with the first. He will need to deposit his currently held wood into the closest chest thus freeing up space in his inventory for when he is ready to collect more wood.

[1690323939534]The first task on Thomas's list is to chop wood. However, looking at his surroundings, there are no trees, just stumps and pieces of wood already chopped. Since Thomas's backpack is nearly full (9 out of 10) and the closest piece of wood is almost 7m away, it would make more sense for Thomas to complete his second task which is store the wood in the chest before collecting more wood.

Reasoning: Collecting the wood could result in an overflow of Thomas's backpack, thus it is more efficient to first deposit the wood in the nearby chest which is only about 0.13m away.

[1690323952968]Given that Thomas' tasks are to chop wood, store wood in the chest, and cook dinner, in that order, and considering his inventory and environment, he should first go chop some wood. As we can see, the nearest Wood item is 6.93116m away. Thomas has an Axe in his inventory which he can use to chop the wood. After chopping, he should take the wood and store it in the chest that is 0.1317396m away; afterwards, he can proceed to his last task which is to cook dinner.

[1690323974040]Plan: 
[1690323974040]Based on the tasks list and available actions, Thomas needs to keep chopping wood before he deposits them in the chest and eventually cooks dinner. Given his inventory is almost full, he would need to inject the action of moving to the chest to deposit the wood. However, the most efficient task he can complete at this time is to chop the closest tree, which is at X: 4.14, Y: -3.64. This would allow him to add more wood to his inventory, after which he can deposit the wood onto the chest at X: -5.51, Y: -4.46. Although, add the fact that he is a brave, calm, and honest lumberjack, he perfectly aligns with the needs of his job and works with utmost dedication.

[1690323988600]Plan: 
[1690323988601]Thomas Smith's tasks are to chop wood, store wood in chest, and cook dinner. However, he can't store wood in the chest because his inventory is full. He needs to drop some wood to make space in his inventory. Then, he can proceed to chop down the tree in his hitbox and store the chopped wood in the chest.

Reasoning: Since Thomas Smith's priority task is to chop wood, but his inventory is full, the logical first step would be to make space in his inventory. Subsequently, he can proceed with chopping down the tree and then storing the logs in the chest.

[1690324001684]Plan: 
[1690324001684]As per the highest priority task, Thomas needs to chop wood. He is currently standing near a tree (his hitbox includes a tree with health 10/10). He already has an axe in his inventory which he can use to chop the wood. After chopping the wood he can move to the chest to store the wood as per the priority 2 task. This movement will be required because currently there is no chest in his vicinity. Finally, for the task of cooking dinner, he can do it after finishing the prior two tasks. 

From the available actions, the action of swinging an axe, i.e., "SwingAxe" is relevant right now for accomplishing the task of chopping wood.

[1690324026477]Plan: 
[1690324026477]Given that the first priority task is to chop wood and Thomas is currently near a tree with health 5/10, the best action is to chop the tree until it turns into wood which can be added to his inventory.

If Thomas's inventory is full, he needs to drop some wood first before swinging the axe to make room for the newly chopped wood. However, his inventory is currently full, which means he won't have room to pick up the new wood. Therefore, he should first drop a piece of wood from his inventory onto the ground.

After dropping the wood and clearing some inventory space, he can swing his axe to chop the tree. Once the tree has been completely chopped down and turns into wood, he can pick up the wood and add it to his inventory. 

Then, he can proceed to complete his second priority task which is to move to the chest and store the wood.

The final task would be to cook dinner. However, there's no information about how to cook dinner so there's no action to be taken for this at the moment.

Given this plan, the first immediate action is to drop a piece of wood from his inventory.

[1690324051194]Plan: 
[1690324051194]Given his current task list, Thomas Smith needs to chop wood at the highest priority, then store the chopped wood in chest followed by cooking dinner.
Looking at Thomas Smith's previous memories and actions, he seems to be already in the process of chopping wood. With a health of 5/10, the tree in his hitbox needs a few more chops to completely fall. He already has 8 pieces of Wood in his inventory, and he can carry up to 10 items.
Once he is done chopping the tree, he should carry the wood back to the chest (-5.51,-4.46) to store it, as it is his second highest priority.
The location of the chest is not mentioned in the report, but looking at Thomas Smith's memories, he had previously walked to the chest at location (-5.51,-4.46). Assuming that the chest is still located there, that would be the location he needs to go to store the wood.
After storing the wood, he can proceed to his third task of cooking dinner.
Based on the description, we don't know the requirements to accomplish the task of cooking dinner, such as whether a kitchen or specific ingredients are required. Therefore, we should focus on completing the first two tasks; as he completes these tasks, additional information may become available which could guide his next steps.
Based on this plan, the immediate action Thomas should take is to continue chopping the tree in his hitbox. After chopping the tree, he can pick up the wood (if it doesn't automatically get added to his inventory), then move to the chest to store the wood.

[1690324069219]Plan: 
[1690324069219]Based on the character's current state and tasks, the character should first move to drop off his current inventory, as it is full with wood, which satisfies the "Store wood in chest" task. Afterwards, he should move to the nearest Tree Stump (at coordinates X: 2.72, Y: -5.11) to accomplish the "Chop wood" task.

Reasoning: His current task list puts chopping wood as the highest priority. However, since his inventory is full already, he first needs to empty that. Afterward, he should where he left off and continue chopping wood. The "Cook dinner" task is third in line and should be done after the two other tasks are completed.

Given the available information, pick the best available action to accomplish your tasks. Respond in JSON: { type: [ActionType], data: {characterId optional parameters}}. Please note that if an action is in the available items list, you can execute it immediately, without needing to change or move. First you should list your reasoning and create a plan, and then using that plan, select an action and create a JSON object for that action with the necessary info. The JSON object must be immediately after "Action: " as we're using regex to parse it.

[1690324085845]Plan: 
[1690324085845]Given the information available, Thomas Smith need to fulfil his tasks ordered by their priorities. The first task "Chop wood" can't be executed at the moment because all the available wooden resources are too far away and his inventory is full. Therefore, he has to focus on his second task, "Store wood in chest". Since his inventory is full with wood and he already has a chest nearby, he should then deposit the wood from his inventory into the chest.

[1690324097543]Plan: 
[1690324097544]First, Thomas needs to finish chopping wood. He will need to navigate to the wood location and then use his axe to chop it. Once he has gathered the wood, he will move to the chest to store it, which is his second task. Once both tasks regarding the wood gathering are completed, he will be free to move on to his final task, cooking dinner.

[1690324116658]Plan: 
[1690324116658]Given the tasks to chop wood and store wood in the chest, it seems that Thomas needs to gather more wood. However, his inventory is currently full (10/10), most of which is filled with wood (9 slots). Therefore, the immediate task would be to make space to accommodate more wood. As his current location is near a chest, it would be best to store the wood in the chest first. 

After making space in the inventory, Thomas can go back to chopping down trees. It will be helpful to pick trees that are closest to his location to save time. After chopping the wood, he can pick it up and store it in the chest if his inventory is full again. The third task of cooking dinner will be performed after these other tasks are completed.

Based on this plan, the best action to start with would be to move to the chest and store the wood there. So the JSON action would be: 

Action: 
{ "type": "MoveTo", "data": { "characterId": "A1", "x": -5.51, "y": -4.46 }}

[1690324140437]Plan: 
[1690324140437]First, Thomas needs to chop some wood as it's his highest priority task. If there's no tree near him, he needs to find a tree and move to it. After chopping the wood, he needs to collect them. As his inventory is already full, he should first drop off his collected woods to the nearby chest. After that, he should move back to collect the chopped wood. Keep on repeating until there's no wood or no tree left. Then he will proceed to his next task which is cooking dinner. However, that action is not currently available.

Reasoning:

Currently, Thomas has no nearby tree that he could chop and his inventory is already full. He needs to free up some space from his inventory.

Action:

Thomas should drop off his wood to the nearby chest. To do so, he should execute the AddItemToChest action. Here is the JSON object for that action:

Action: { "type": "AddItemToChest", "data": { "characterId": "A1", "chestId": "chest_(-5.51,-4.46)", "itemId": "wood" }}

Note: The `characterId` parameter refers to the ID of the character you are controlling. The `chestId` parameter refers to the ID of the chest where you want to store the item. The `itemId` parameter refers to the ID of the item you wish to store.

[1690324170378]Plan: 
[1690324170378]Thomas has been busy chopping down trees and storing the wood in the chest. His first task is to continue chopping wood, however, there are no more trees in sight, only stumps which he apparently just finished working on. Therefore, he can't accomplish his current task and needs to move on to the next priority: storing the wood he has in the chest.

The base for cooking dinner, the final task, will be wood which is still in his inventory or can be retrieved from the chest. However, it also highly likely requires other items not currently apparent (like food items or a pot), which he will have to retrieve or otherwise deal with in the future.

His current inventory has 8 pieces of wood and the chest has a capacity of 10. From his memories, it is recalled that he deposited wood into the chest three times, which, assuming he put in the max amount each time, means the chest could potentially be full. However, as he only dropped the wood and doesn't seem to have placed any other items, it's likely that the chest is not completely full, so he can put in the wood he is currently carrying.

After he stores the wood, he can consider his next course of action, which may include looking for food items, a pot, or a fire-making tool to fulfill his third task.

[1690324187618]Plan: 
[1690324187618]While the current environment data doesn't show any uncut trees, Thomas still has a task to chop wood. Since memory data shows he stopped seeing Tree (10) 6 minutes ago, it might be possible that it's back.
First, he should move to the location of Tree (10) and, if available, chop it. If Tree (10) is not available, a new action plan will be needed.

Next, he should move to the chest and deposit the wood into it since his second priority is to store wood in the chest.

The third task to cook dinner isn't immediately achievable as there are no available actions for this. This would probably involve gathering more items, possibly hunting for food. But it doesn't fit in the provided plan at this moment.

By analyzing the data, the best action at this point would be to attempt to move to the last known location of Tree (10) and try to chop it.

[1690324208858]Plan: 
[1690324208858]Thomas Smith, the lumberjack character, has a priority task to chop wood. Looking at his environment, there doesn't seem to be any full trees left to chop, only stumps. Besides, his hitbox also indicates that he could hit the tree stump near him. Therefore, the most optimal move would be to swing his axe to the nearest stump.

Reasoning:
1) The 'Chop wood' task has the highest priority.
2) There are nearby tree stumps within Thomas's hitbox. He can directly hit these without needing to move. 
3) His inventory still has space (9/10), so he will be able to carry the wood he will collect from the stumps.
4) After chopping the wood, he can carry on with his secondary task of storing the wood in the chest.

[1690324227013]Plan: 
[1690324227013]Considering the available actions and Thomas's task list, he would ideally do the following:

1. Walk to the closest wood on the ground (since "Chop wood" is the highest priority task), however, his inventory is full, and he needs to clear some space first. This leads us to step 2.

2. Drop one wood from his inventory onto the ground. This will free up space in his inventory to carry more wood.

3. After freeing up space in his inventory, Thomas can then walk to the piece of wood closest to him and pick it up.

4. He then needs to store the collected wood in the chest.

5. Finally, he can cook dinner when the first two tasks are completed.

So the best immediate action is to drop one piece of wood from his inventory onto the ground.

[1690324242996]Plan: 
[1690324242996]As per the task list, the first task is to chop wood, followed by storing the wood in the chest, and then to cook dinner. Currently, Thomas has an axe in his inventory and three pieces of wood are available in his environment for him to chop. Thomas also has 8 pieces of wood in his inventory. The available actions do not list the ability to pick up more wood, and Thomas' inventory is nearly full. So, the best course of action for completing the task would be for Thomas to first drop the wood from his inventory to make room, and then to move to the nearest pile of wood to chop it. Once the chopping task is done, he can pick up the wood, move to the chest to store the wood. After that, he can move on to cook dinner.

[1690324261214]Plan: 
[1690324261214]1. Since Thomas's first priority task is chopping wood and he's already located near a tree stump and there's wood lying around, it's apparent that he's been fulfilling this task. However, his inventory shows that it's nearly filled to the maximum with the wood he has already chopped. 

2. Therefore, before he can continue chopping, Thomas needs to clear some space in his inventory. This means he has to proceed to his second priority task: storing the wood in a chest. 

3. Given Thomas's past memory of depositing wood in a chest at coordinates X: -5.51, Y: -4.46, it suggests that this is where a storage chest is located.

4. Hence, Thomas should move to the location of the storage chest and deposit his collected wood there.

Given the available information, pick the best available action to accomplish your tasks. Respond in JSON: { type: [ActionType], data: {characterId optional parameters}}. Please note that if an action is in the available items list, you can execute it immediately, without needing to change or move. First you should list your reasoning and create a plan, and then using that plan, select an action and create a JSON object for that action with the necessary info. The JSON object must be immediately after "Action: " as we're using regex to parse it.

[1690324281375]Plan: 
[1690324281375]Since Thomas's inventory is full and the top priority task is to chop wood, Thomas should first move to the chest's location and deposit his inventory full of wood blocks. 

Once he's cleared up his inventory, he can then move to the nearest tree stump's location and begin chopping wood.

Upon completing the chopping task, the next task is to store wood in the chest, for this he should then return to the chest and deposit the chopped wood.

Then finally, the last task can be accomplished which is to cook dinner. This task doesn't involve a specific action at the moment. 

So, the immediate action that Thomas should perform is to deposit wood blocks in the chest.

Here is the JSON action needed for that:

[1690324295364]Plan: 
[1690324295365]1. Since Thomas already has the wood in his inventory and his first given task is to chop wood (which he has already done), the next step for him would be to store wood in the chest close to him, considering his available actions, tasks and his current location relative to the chest.
2. After that, Thomas's next priority would be to cook dinner. Since there is currently no information available regarding food or a campfire, further planning for this task is not possible.

Action: 
Based on the plan above, the first action Thomas performs is to deposit the wood he has in his inventory to the chest.

[1690324310498]Plan: 
[1690324310498]Given that Thomas Smith's topmost priority task is to "Chop wood" and that he still has 2 slots left in his inventory, he should begin by moving towards the Tree Stump closest to him (which is at X: 0.86, Y: -0.9 at a distance of 7.14295m). He can then proceed to chop the wood. Once his inventory is full, he can then carry out the second priority task, which is to "Store wood in chest". 

Based on this plan, the immediate action should be for Thomas to move to the nearest Tree Stump.

[1690324337675]Plan: 
[1690324337675]With the current setup, Thomas should focus on task priority 1, which is "Chop wood." He has an axe and is next to a tree stump (with full health), so he's prepared to start chopping. The priority 2 task is "Store wood in chest", but this is not necessary until he has completed chopping wood. The priority 3 task, "Cook dinner", is not feasible right now because we do not have information about a fire or food available. Here are the steps to complete the tasks:

Step 1: Chop the Tree Stump
Step 2: Collect the Wood
Step 3: Move to the Chest
Step 4: Store Wood in the Chest
Step 5: Find food (not specified in task nor available in the environment)
Step 6: Cook dinner (if possible)

Given the prioritized task list and current state of the environment, Thomas's best immediate action would be to start chopping the wood.

Given the available information, pick the best available action to accomplish your tasks. Respond in JSON: { type: [ActionType], data: {characterId optional parameters}}. Please note that if an action is in the available items list, you can execute it immediately, without needing to change or move. First you should list your reasoning and create a plan, and then using that plan, select an action and create a JSON object for that action with the necessary info. The JSON object must be immediately after "Action: " as we're using regex to parse it.

[1690324360258]Plan: 
[1690324360258]Given the tasks at hand, Thomas needs to chop more wood and then store it in the chest. We know he is close to two piles of wood (distances of 2m and a bit above 2m), so he should pick up those pieces first. After collecting this ungathered wood, he should return to the chest and deposit his new loot. Cooking dinner is not a priority at the moment.

1. Pick up first set of Wood (a6d3fb38-8604-4161-9fe3-302cca5deb8b)
2. Pick up second set of Wood (03e32333-2f07-425c-a718-33482cd4cd23)
3. Thomas Smith walked to chest
4. Deposit wood into chest

Given the above, the next most appropriate action would be to pick up the first sets of Wood.

- Insight: The types of objects in Thomas Smith's surroundings included trees, stumps (cloned), and a chest, indicating a natural or outdoor setting, potentially an artificially created or game environment due to the existence of cloned items and designated object naming (because of statements 10). [just now]
- Insight: Thomas Smith's visibility of objects appears to have been affected or lost, possibly indicating movement on his part (because of statements 10). [just now]
- Insight: Thomas Smith was in an outdoor or natural environment because the items he lost sight of are typically found outdoors like trees and stumps (because of 5). [just now]
- Insight: Thomas Smith was also visible to a chest which could imply he might have been in some sort of game or adventure (because of 10). [just now]

[1690324378229]Plan: 
[1690324378229]Based on the information provided and the tasks at hand, the best course of action is for Thomas to first knock down the nearby trees and collect more wood. Since chopping down wood is his first priority task and there's still free space in his inventory. 

Following that, he should go back to the chest to deposit the wood as this is his second priority task and it was established by his previous 'memories' that this is part of his habits. The last task will be to cook dinner but we do not have the necessary components to execute that task at the moment. 

The action that should be taken is to chop the wood.

[1690324394715]Plan: 
[1690324394715]Thomas Smith has the task of chopping wood as the highest priority. His inventory is almost full with 8 pieces of wood and he has sufficient tools, an axe, to chop more. First, he should deposit the wood he has into a chest, particularly because the chest is closer than any of the piece of wood or tree stumps that he can chop. Once this is done, he should locate the nearest piece of wood or tree stump and start chopping.

Action based on the plan:
- First action: Store the wood in the chest.
- Second action: Chop the wood from the nearest source.
- Third action: Store the wood in the chest and repeat the process until his task is complete.

Therefore, the first immediate action to perform is to move to the chest's location and store the wood in it.

[1690324409325]Plan: 
[1690324409326]Thomas Smith has a priority task to chop wood. As he has space in his inventory, he can accommodate more wood. However, there are no trees nearby based on the environment. Thus, he will need to move to a location where there are trees that he can chop down. After collecting enough wood, he needs to store the collected wood in the chest, which is in his vicinity. After that, he will cook dinner.

[1690324429524]Plan: 
[1690324429525]Given Thomas Smith's tasks, he needs to prioritize chopping wood and storing the wood in the chest over cooking dinner. 

According to the available actions, Thomas can only chop the Tree Stump because it's in his hitbox, that is, within the range of a swing-based action.

Therefore:

1. Thomas should swing the axe at the Tree Stump in order to chop wood.
2. Afterwards, Thomas Smith will then need to move to the chest's location, which is currently a distance of 8.127153m away. 
3. Once at the chest's location, he should deposit the wood into the chest.
4. Return to step 1.

[1690324446225]Plan: 
[1690324446225]Thomas Smith has a full inventory, and, based on the tasks he has, it is reasonable to start by dropping off the wood at the closest chest in order to clear the inventory space for his next task - chopping down wood from the nearby tree. After the wood has been deposited, Thomas can then proceed to fulfil his first task by moving towards the closest wood (2.514951, -2.119336) to chop it.

After chopping down wood, Thomas can pick up the nearby wood and repeat the process until his inventory is full or until all the surrounding wood has been chopped down. Once all the wood has been exhausted, Thomas can then move to the chest to deposit the wood and move on to his third task - cooking dinner, which requires a more detailed description of the environment. But for now, depositing the wood to the chest seems to be the most effective task.

[1690324471845]Plan: 
[1690324471845]First, Thomas Smith should pick up the wood that is slightly farther from him (distance: 8.275923m) as his inventory still has space. After picking up the wood, since his first task is to chop wood, he can go on to chop a tree, provided there is one nearby that he can successfully hit with his axe. Following this, provided his inventory gets full with the chopped wood, he can store the wood in his chest which is his second task. This sequential way of doing tasks will be most efficient. As per his third task, he needs to cook dinner however no resources or actions for this task have been provided at the moment.

Once he's done with these two tasks, if he's given resources to cook or task to gather resources for cooking, he can continue with his third task.

Action:
To move ahead with the plan, first he needs to move toward the wood, pick it up and then go on from there. Here's the JSON object for the action:

[1690324495097]Plan: 
[1690324495097]1. Thomas has to perform tasks in order by priority.
2. First, he needs to chop wood. But his inventory is full now. Therefore, he should drop a piece of wood on the ground to make space for the newly chopped wood.
3. Then move towards the nearest piece of wood to chop it.
4. After that, he will store the wood in the chest.
5. Lastly, he would cook the dinner.

Reasoning: The first task requires Thomas to chop wood. But due to full inventory, if he tries to chop wood, he will not be able to collect it. Thus, he should create room by dropping a piece of wood on the ground then move toward the wood log to chop it.

[1690324506509]Plan: 
[1690324506510]Firstly, Thomas needs to chop more wood to fill up his inventory as his first task is to chop wood and the wood near him is at a lesser distance than the chest. After he collects the wood, he needs to move to the chest and deposit the wood as per his second task. The third task "Cook dinner" is not provided with respective action, hence can be ignored for now.

[1690324520417]Plan: 
[1690324520417]Given the tasks at hand, the first thing Thomas needs to do is to continue chopping wood. Since his inventory is currently full, he will need to drop a piece of wood to make room for the newly chopped wood. After dropping the wood, he should proceed towards the closest piece of wood to chop it as per his first task priority. This will be followed by depositing the chopped wood in the chest as per his second task priority. Moreover, to ensure accomplishment of his third task, he needs to reserve some wood in the inventory for cooking dinner.

Given the above priorities, the immediate action would be to move closer to the nearest piece of wood and use the axe to chop it.

[1690324538896]Plan: 
[1690324538896]Looking at the tasks, Thomas Smith needs to chop wood, store wood in chest, and cook dinner. His inventory is currently full with wood. The first two tasks, chopping and storing wood, are highly dependent on the state of his inventory and his proximity to more wood and the chest for storage. Cooking dinner is likely dependent on the availability of other resources, like a cooking station, which has not yet been located or identified. 

Considering the priority of tasks and the state of things, the best course of action at the moment is for Thomas to store the wood he's already collected into a chest before he goes back to chop more wood. The memories suggest a chest is located at X: -5.51, Y: -4.46.

Given the available information, pick the best available action to accomplish your tasks. Respond in JSON: { type: [ActionType], data: {characterId optional parameters}}. Please note that if an action is in the available items list, you can execute it immediately, without needing to change or move. First you should list your reasoning and create a plan, and then using that plan, select an action and create a JSON object for that action with the necessary info. The JSON object must be immediately after "Action: " as we're using regex to parse it.

[1690324566993]Plan: 
[1690324566993]Since Thomas Smith's current task with the highest priority is to "Chop Wood", my first action will be to find some trees to chop down. Since his last couple of swings with the axe didn't hit any trees, and I know from his memories that he lost sight of some nearby trees (indicating he may have moved), the first step would be to have Thomas move. The logs from his previous action don't indicate the presence of trees at his current location, so Thomas should move until he finds some. 

Then, once he has choppped enough wood, I'll move onto the second task, which is to store the wood in the chest. His inventory is currently full, but the chest he has been using (and continues to be nearby to, at X:-5.51 & Y: -4.46) has enough space. So once he's done chopping, he should go back to the chest, deposit the wood, and then move onto the third task.

The third task is "Cook Dinner", but there's no information about how to do this or what items would be required. Thomas might need to gather more supplies, but there's not enough information to plan out how to address this task at the moment.

Let's proceed with moving to find more trees. You'll need a MoveTo action, though without any information on where trees might be I can't specify a direction.

[1690324587753]Plan: 
[1690324587753]It's important to consider Thomas' main occupation as a lumberjack, his primary task is to chop wood which supports this occupation. The chest is 0.1452453 meters away which indicates that he's nearby it. As the chest doesn't have any wood inside it. Thomas should chop wood and then store it in the chest.

Given the above, the best action to take would be to chop wood first by swinging his axe. After a good amount of wood has been chopped, the next action would be to deposit the chopped wood into the chest. Thomas needs to continue this cycle until his task list has been completed. 

Seeing that Thomas' visible hitbox does not contain any trees, he must move first before he can chop down more wood. Thomas should move back to where there were previously trees to chop:

1. Move to a location with trees (previously logged)
2. Swing axe to chop wood
3. Store wood in the chest
4. Repeat until inventory is full
5. Cook dinner (priority 3 task) the done with the wood-chopping task.

[1690324610788]Plan: 
[1690324610789]Given the prioritized tasks and Thomas Smith's full inventory, the character must first drop some of the wood from his inventory since it is full hence he can't chop more wood. After dropping some wood, the next step would be to transport it to the chest. His further steps will be based on the chest capacity and destination of dropped wood.

Reasoning:

1) The character's task priority is to chop wood, store it in a chest and then cook dinner.
2) The character's inventory is full with Wood, therefore he needs to drop some to chop more wood.
3) He needs to store the wood in the chest after he has dropped some. There are no mentions of meal preparation items or a fire source in the environment description, so the task of cooking dinner may be a later or offscreen task.

[1690324630006]Plan: 
[1690324630007]- Thomas Smith's highest priority task is to chop wood. He has an Axe in his inventory and there are three pieces of wood in the vicinity.
- He should first move to the nearest piece of wood for him to chop. This is the piece with item ID '6cb1ff44-0382-413c-9737-81fd0ce2aa80' which is approximately 0.09 meters away.
- After chopping the wood, depending on how much wood he gets, he will either continue chopping until his inventory is full or move on to the next task if his inventory is already full.
- The next priority task is to store the wood in the chest. This will involve him moving to the location of the chest, which has coordinates X: -5.51, Y: -4.46.
- Having stored the wood in the chest, Thomas can then move on to his third task; cooking dinner. As there are no further details provided for this task, we can assume he will need to move to a specified location to carry this out.

Using this plan, the next best action is to move to the nearest wood.

[1690324649690]Plan: 
[1690324649690]Given the character's tasks and his inventory, the best course of action is to first move to the location of the wood closest to him and chop the wood.

Reasoning: 

Thomas Smith's primary task is to chop wood and he does currently have an axe in his inventory making him able to perform the task. He is also a bit closer to the 372799af-8635-4bbe-aea6-df959f5fe65c wood so he should go there first. After chopping this wood, he can then go to the other one ('a6d3fb38-8604-4161-9fe3-302cca5deb8b'). 

Action: 

The action that Thomas should take next is to move to the location of '372799af-8635-4bbe-aea6-df959f5fe65c'. This is because it is closer and chopping wood is his highest priority task.

[1690324657318]Plan: 
[1690324657318]1. Because his top priority is to chop wood and considering his inventory is full, he should drop a piece of wood to make space.
2. Then, he should move to the closest piece of wood and chop it.
3. After this, he should store the chopped wood in the chest.
4. Finally, he should make dinner, which is his lowest priority task.

Based on this plan, the most immediate action should be to drop a piece of wood from his inventory.

[1690324700650]Plan: 
[1690324700650]Thomas Smith's current highest priority task is "Chop wood". In order to do that, he needs to move to the closest available wood. Using the environmental data, the closest available wood is Wood with Item ID a6d3fb38-8604-4161-9fe3-302cca5deb8b that is at a distance of 4.318685m, coordinates [X: 2.727753, Y: -0.7126138]. Once he's at the wood location, he can use his axe in the inventory to chop the wood. However, his inventory is currently full. He would need to drop some wood from his inventory first before he could add the new wood.

After he has chopped the wood, his next highest priority task is "Store wood in chest". The available chest is at coordinates [X: -5.51, Y: -4.46]. He would need to move to this location and then store the wood in the chest. After that, his final task is to "Cook dinner". This task requires additional information that is not currently available.

To summarize, the plan is:

1. Drop some wood from his inventory.
2. Move to the closest available wood.
3. Chop the wood.
4. Move to the chest location.
5. Store the newly chopped wood in the chest.

Action:
For the first step of the plan, Thomas Smith should drop some wood from his inventory to make some space. Once he's done that, he can move to the closest Wood location. So the current action should be to drop the Wood. Here's the JSON for it:

[1690324737920]Plan: 
[1690324737920]1. Free up inventory space: Currently, Thomas's inventory is full, with wood occupying nine out of ten slots, which prevents him from carrying out any new tasks relating to the collection of items. Since dropping the wood in the environment and placing it in the chest fulfills the task of "store wood in chest," the first step would be to move to the chest and deposit the wood.
2. Chop the wood: Once inventory space is freed, Thomas can go back to the closest piece of wood and chop it. This action accomplishes the "chop wood" task.
3. Cook dinner: Although the details of this task are not provided, assuming it requires firewood and Thomas being near a specific spot (e.g., a fire pit), he would need to use some of the chopped wood and move to that location. If additional items are needed (like food items for cooking), he may have to search for or go to those items before being able to cook dinner.

[1690324759208]Plan: 
[1690324759208]Based on Thomas Smith's tasks and inventory, the optimal plan is to:
1. Chop more wood from nearby trees using the axe.
2. Store the chopped wood into the nearby chest. The chest is already in visible range to Thomas.
3. After that, he can proceed to cook dinner. However, there's no detailed information about cooking. If required, he can collect more wood for fire.

As there's nothing mentioned about the cooking task, we'll focus on his first two tasks. Chopping wood is a higher priority task than storing wood. As Thomas currently has maximum carried items in his inventory, he needs to make space by storing some of the wood in the chest before he can chop more wood.

Action: The first step would therefore be to store the wood in his inventory into the chest.

The JSON object will be as follows:

[1690324769918]Plan: 
[1690324769918]The first priority task is to Chop Wood. Since Thomas Smith, the lumberjack, already has an axe in his inventory, he does not need to move or search for an axe. He can start by swinging his axe to chop some wood. Given his occupation and the task's priority, it's evident that chopping wood is a critical and familiar task for him.

[1690324795695]Plan: 
[1690324795695]Based on the available information and tasks, the priority is to chop wood, store the wood in the chest and then cook dinner. Thomas Smith is currently located close to the chest. His inventory contains 8 wood pieces and he posses an axe. There is no information about the immediate surrounding if there are any trees left to chop. 

Since there is enough space in the inventory, Thomas could move to a tree location (if visible) and start chopping wood to gather more resources before storing them into the chest.

Reasoning:
- The task "Chop Wood" is of higher priority.
- Thomas has an axe in the inventory which is needed for chopping wood.
- In case there are trees nearby, moving to a tree location and chopping wood would make sense. If not, he can skip to the next higher priority task. 

When inspecting the task and assuming there are no trees visible or in reach, Smith should focus on the second task, which is to store the already chopped wood in the chest.

Reasoning:
- It is mentioned Thomas has recently (1 minute ago) deposited Wood into the chest.
- There is still wood inventory present (8 units).
- The chest's location is known and close to the current position.
- If no trees are available, depositing the remaining wood in the chest follows the priority of the tasks.

The JSON object for this action would be:

[1690324827119]Plan: 
[1690324827119]Looking at Thomas Smith's tasks, the highest priority task is to chop wood. This can be achieved by swinging his axe. However, last time he rook this action, he didn't hit any trees, perhaps because they were all cut down. Therefore, he will need to move to a new location first. After that, the next task is to store the wood in the chest, which he can do once he has obtained more wood. Finally, his last task is to cook dinner, but we do not have any details about how this task can be accomplished or the necessary resources to do so. 

According to Thomas's prior actions, he can move to a specific location and swing his axe, potentially resulting in wood if there are trees present. It appears like after cutting down trees, he drops the wood and then moves closer to the chest to deposit the wood. In his last few actions, he seemed to have been trying to cut wood but didn't hit any trees and then went ahead to deposit wood in the chest, implying that he still had wood left in his inventory.

Based on these insights, Thomas should probably move to a new location where there are trees present and swing his axe to chop wood. After gathering enough, he should then move to the chest and deposit the wood before thinking about the final task, which is to cook dinner. 

First order of action would be to move to a new location. Let's direct him to move to coordinate (X: 2.756184, Y: -5.025853), the location he last dropped wood. It might indicate that there are trees in that area.

[1690324849615]Plan: 
[1690324849615]As per the tasks, the highest priority task for Thomas Smith is to "Chop wood". From the environment data given, we understand that there are two woods available nearby at distances 2.845682m and 4.254259m. He can walk towards a piece of wood and chop it.

After chopping enough wood, the next task would be to "Store wood in chest". The chest's coordinates are also given in the environment details and it is 8.136367m away. After chopping the wood, Smith can walk towards the chest and deposit the chopped wood into it.

The final task is to "Cook dinner". However, we don't have any ingredients or tools mentioned in the data to carry out this task.

Given the available data, I would make Thomas move towards the wood closest to him and start chopping it.

So, let's perform the first part of the task and make him move towards the wood at coordinates (3.366095, -2.221681).

[1690324865329]Plan: 
[1690324865329]Being a lumberjack, the primary task for Thomas is to chop wood, followed by depositing it in a chest and then cooking dinner. As per the inventory, Thomas already possesses an axe and has already chopped 8 wood blocks. 

The tasks imply that he is supposed to deposit the wood blocks into a chest better before cooking. Memories show that he has already been depositing the wood at a chest located at coordinates X: -5.51, Y: -4.46.

Considering his inventory is almost full (9/10), he should head towards the chest to deposit the wood blocks. So, the movement action will be executed, taking Thomas to the chest.

Based on this, the best action would be to move to the chest location.

[1690324892977]Plan: 
[1690324892977]Given the top priority task is to chop wood, and he currently possesses an axe, the best course of action for Thomas Smith would be to find a tree and use his axe to chop wood. However, I cannot see an available action or the position of a tree, which could be necessary for completing this task. I see that he has carried out some of these tasks recently, including chopping wood and depositing wood in a chest. 

On the other hand, since the second task in priority demands storing wood in the chest, and considering the fact that he currently possesses 8 pieces of wood in his inventory, he can complete this task by adding the wood into the chest. 

In conclusion, the best available action is to store the wood in the chest as the task of chopping more wood cannot be accomplished currently due to lack of necessary information.

[1690324910400]Plan: 
[1690324910400]The primary task is to chop wood, followed by storing the wood in the chest, and then finally cooking dinner. Based on the environment's description, Thomas might be in a game environment or artificial adventure. As per his visibility, he had a direct line of sight of a chest. 

Given the list of available actions, Thomas can swing his axe to chop down the trees he previously had in sight. As his inventory can accommodate two more items, he's able to store the chopped woods. Once his inventory is full, he should then proceed to deposit the woods into the chest since this is an identified location. 

Lastly, there's no immediate information or available action relevant to preparing dinner. However, if the game environment or the experience allows, Thomas can use some of the woods as fuel for a fire (presuming he has the necessary tools and skills for this).

[1690324925985]Plan: 
[1690324925985]Thomas Smith's first priority is to chop wood. However, as of now there are no trees nearby in the immediate hitbox to chop from. In order to fulfill this task, Thomas will need to move to an area where there are trees.

After that, since Thomas has already collected wood in his inventory, he can deposit this in the chest, which matches with his second task. Since he is already near the chest, this step will be accomplished easily after chopping some wood.

His third task is to cook dinner. However, we do not have any details about this in the given information. We may need to wait for more information or updates in order to accomplish this task.

[1690324943399]Plan: 
[1690324943399]Since Thomas Smith's highest priority task is to chop wood and he already has an axe in his inventory, he should immediately proceed to chop the wood in his surroundings. After chopping a sufficient amount of wood, depending on his inventory capacity, he should move to the chest location to deposit the wood, as per his second task.

Given the available information, pick the best available action to accomplish your tasks. Respond in JSON: { type: [ActionType], data: {characterId optional parameters}}. Please note that if an action is in the available items list, you can execute it immediately, without needing to change or move. First you should list your reasoning and create a plan, and then using that plan, select an action and create a JSON object for that action with the necessary info. The JSON object must be immediately after "Action: " as we're using regex to parse it.

[1690324952152]Plan: 
[1690324952152]Thomas Smith's first task is to chop wood. He has an axe in his inventory. Since there is wood near him, I propose that he goes and chops it. After chopping, he needs to collect the wood, which will align with his second task to store the wood in the chest. After these steps, his last task is to cook dinner. This does not appear feasible at this moment since no action dictates how this can be accomplished.

Initial Action: Chop wood.

[1690324970873]Plan: 
[1690324970873]Given the priority of tasks, Thomas should continue his task of chopping wood. After that, he should move towards the chest coordinates (X: -5.51, Y: -4.46) to store the chopped wood. Finally, once these two tasks have been done, he can proceed to cook dinner.

From the recent memories and previous actions he has performed, we can deduce that Thomas couldn't hit any trees with his axe, meaning he might need to move closer to the trees.

Seeing the recent list of actions, it appears that swinging the axe doesn't directly correlate with coordinates of hitting a tree. However, several successful deposits of wood into the chest (-5.51, -4.46) have been made. Therefore, there could potentially be a tree near this chest that he's been successful at before. Now, he is 1.671918m away from a wood. It could be a tree, and it could be the same tree he's been successful with in the past.

Firstly, let's check if the wood in question corresponds to a tree by moving closer to those coordinates. Then, Thomas should be able to chop the wood more effectively.

[1690324988479]Plan: 
[1690324988479]Given that Thomas Smith's inventory is almost full and the first priority task is to chop more wood, it would make sense for him to first deposit the wood he already has into the chest before he can continue chopping. Also, considering his previous locations and actions, he recently moved away from the chest (located at X: -5.51, Y: -4.46) which contains previously collected wood. Therefore, Thomas should first move back to the location of the chest, and then deposit the current wood in his inventory into the chest.

Action:

Once he's moved to the chest, Thomas will need to execute the action to deposit the wood he's carrying. So, the immediate action for Thomas is to move back to the location of the chest.

[1690325008759]Plan: 
[1690325008759]First, Thomas needs to chop more wood as his first priority task as well as to ensure he has enough wood to cook the dinner, which is his third priority task. After he has enough wood, he would need to store the wood in the chest. The action [SwingAxe] can be used to chop the wood and gather more from the environment.

Reasoning:

If Thomas first fulfills the highest priority task of chopping wood, he ensures he is prepared with the needed resource for his other tasks. Furthermore, his location appears to be close to a chest where he can store the wood. This will help him efficiently complete the second priority task of storing the wood in the chest.

[1690325023748]Plan: 
[1690325023748]First, Thomas needs to continue chopping wood to fulfill his first priority task. Given the lack of trees around him, he may need to move to a new location, however, the information provided does not include potential new locations. If he stays at his current location and continues to swing his axe, he won't hit any trees as per the provided hitbox.

Once he has enough wood, he should then proceed to store the wood the chest. This task is straightforward and can be achieved through the AddItemToChest action.

Lastly, regarding the task of cooking dinner, there's no available information suggesting that Thomas possesses the necessary items to cook or even a location where he can cook. Thus, can't make any actions towards this task currently.

[1690325042868]Plan: 
[1690325042868]1. The highest priority task for Thomas Smith is to chop wood. Since he currently has an Axe in his inventory, he can continue chopping wood.

Reasoning:
- Priority 1 task is to chop wood, which Thomas Smith can do with the axe in his inventory.
- Priority 2 task is to store wood in chest. Since the character is a lumberjack and his surroundings indicate he is in an outdoor setting, we can assume that he will be close to the chest he has been consistently using (based on his memories - chest_(-5.51,-4.46)).
- Priority 3 task is to cook dinner, which is not immediately achievable given his current inventory and environment.

[1690325061015]Plan: 
[1690325061015]Thomas Smith needs to accomplish three tasks - Chop wood, store wood in chest, and cook dinner. Based on the priorities, first he needs to chop more wood because his current task is to chop wood which is of the highest priority among his tasks. Looking at his previous actions, Thomas Smith tried to swing his axe but hit 0 trees.

My hypothesis is that he may have run out of trees within his vicinity. The prior insights indicate that he had lost sight of the trees and the occasional cloned stumps, and the location of the chest where he stored his wood was at a different XY coordinate.

It is crucial to move Thomas Smith to a location where there are presumably trees he can chop. After he has enough wood, the next task of storing the wood in chest will be handled. Afterward, he could move on to cook dinner which is the lowest priority task among his tasks for now.

Action: My suggested action is for Thomas Smith to move, in search of trees.

[1690325075134]Plan: 
[1690325075134]1. Thomas needs to finish his first task which is to chop wood. As he is currently in a location where there are trees, he could do the action immediately.
2. Once the wood is chopped, he will add it to his inventory.
3. After collecting the wood, his second task is to store the wood in the chest. He would need to move to the location of the chest (X: -5.51, Y: -4.46).
4. Once he reaches the chest, he would store the chopped wood.
5. His third task is to cook dinner. As there is no information about cooking tools or materials, we cannot formulate a plan for this as of now.

[1690325086898]Plan: 
[1690325086898]Given the current tasks and surroundings, Thomas Smith should aim to chop more wood seeing as he has space in his inventory. Once his inventory is full, he can then store the wood in the chest. Finally, he can proceed with cooking dinner.

Since the available actions do not meet this priority, the most appropriate action to perform next is to move to a location with trees in order to start chopping. From the memories, we know that Thomas Smith's visibility of objects was lost 12 minutes ago, which could indicate that he needs to move back to those coordinates to regain sight of the trees for chopping.

Remembering that the axes used by Thomas Smith hit 0 trees in the past few actions, we need to understand if the issue is with the axe or with the location coordinates. Moving back to the coordinates at which Thomas lost visible objects might solve this issue.

[1690325120300]Plan: 
[1690325120301]Looking at Thomas Smith's tasks, he needs to chop wood first. This action is a priority over storing wood in the chest and cooking dinner. According to his most recent actions, his efforts of chopping wood were unsuccessful as they hit no trees. He'll have to move to a spot with trees in order to chop wood. 

Given his location and the details about the environment, we are not sure where the trees are. It would seem reasonable to move from his current location, perhaps back towards the chest (since trees were chopped there previously), and attempt to swing his axe to chop wood.

Action: Once he's moved, Thomas can attempt to chop wood again. If successful, he can then move onto his next tasks of storing the wood and cooking dinner.

Here is the JSON action for my plan:

[1690325135730]Plan: 
[1690325135730]Based on the tasks, the first priority for Thomas Smith is to chop more wood. However, according to the recent actions, he's not successfully hitting any trees with his axe, suggesting that his current location might be devoid of trees. 

My suggestion would be for Thomas Smith to move to a different location where he can find trees to chop. But since we do not have any data on different locations yet, the next rational action could be to store the wood he has in his inventory into the chest. As it is also part of his tasks and the chest is near to him.

After which, we could then work on finding a new location where there are trees for Thomas Smith to chop to fulfill his first task.

[1690325153851]Plan: 
[1690325153851]Given that Thomas has already collected wood (as evidenced by the 8 logs in his inventory), his next task should be to store the wood in the chest. However, checking the environment, we can see that the chest is slightly outside of reach, indicating that Thomas might need to move closer to it before he can interact with it.

After storing the wood, Thomas should then proceed to cook dinner. There is no actionable item related to this in the task list, so it can be assumed that after the previous task is completed, this will be automatically taken care of.

Based on these observations, the ideal action for Thomas Smith would be to move towards the chest and then store the wood in the chest. However, looking at the available actions, Thomas can directly store the wood in the chest without moving there. So, the action Thomas should take is to store the wood in the chest.

[1690325176542]Plan: 
[1690325176542]Given the tasks and information provided, a prioritized sequence of actions will be organized accordingly:
1. The most immediate task is to chop wood. However, the previous actions state that Thomas tried to swing his axe and hit no trees. It could mean that Thomas is far from any trees. In which case, he needs to move closer to that location.
2. Once he has collected all the wood, his next task is to store the wood in the chest. The chest is nearly 0.11 meters away.
3. Finally, Thomas will need to cook dinner, no specific actions mentioned in the available list. But there is wood in the inventory which can be used as firewood to cook dinner.

Action: 
Based on the plan, the first action to perform is to move closer to the trees.
We can accomplish this using the MoveTo action, but we do not have coordinates for the location of the trees.
We can assume that Thomas was previously near the trees when he was depositing wood in the chest which is at location X: -5.51, Y: -4.46.
Therefore, let's move Thomas to this location. 

Action: 
{ "type": "MoveTo", "data": { "characterId": "A1", "x": -5.51, "y": -4.46 }}

[1690325191966]Plan: 
[1690325191967]Thomas Smith should first complete his high priority task which is to chop wood. Although it's not disclosed in this context how the wood is obtained, it's presumed that Thomas Smith uses his axe to chop down trees for wood. Based on what has been disclosed, there are no trees nearby, otherwise they would be listed in the "hitbox". Therefore, Thomas Smith should move to a location where there are trees available to chop. This location is unknown and has not been disclosed in this context.

Based on this plan, the best available action for Thomas Smith is to move to a different location in hopes of finding trees to chop for wood.

Here is the JSON object for the action:

[1690325220412]Plan: 
[1690325220413]Since Thomas Smith has 7 woods in his inventory, he should first deposit the wood in the chest, which corresponds to the second task. Then he needs to chop more wood according to the first task in the task list. At last, Thomas should cook dinner considering the third task.

Reasoning:
1. Deposit wood: Thomas Smith's inventory currently has 7 woods. As per the task, he needs to deposit wood into the chest. His priority in this case becomes depositing the wood right away.
2. Chop wood: Just after the depositing part, Thomas would need to chop more wood based on his first task. Given his occupation and tools, it seems like a routine task for him to do.
3. Cooking dinner: Once the previous two priority tasks are done, Thomas should proceed to prepare his meal, considering this is his third task from the task list. 

Based on this reasoning, the first action Thomas should take is to deposit wood in the chest.

[1690325251898]Plan: 
[1690325251898]Looking at Thomas's tasks in order of priority, we see that his first task is to chop wood. Since Thomas already has an axe in his inventory, he can use that to chop wood. Afterward, he can store the chopped wood in the chest, which is his second priority task. Finally, Thomas has a task to cook dinner but there doesn't seem to be any information that would allow him to perform this task at the moment.

Reasoning:
- There is no information about an available tree to chop. However, "SwingAxe" action is available and there might be trees around him.
- In terms of distance, the chest is not far from Thomas's location so storing the chopped wood should not present major difficulties.
- There's no indication of any kitchen appliances or any items necessary to cook dinner available in the vicinity, so the final task is not immediately actionable.

Action: 
I will call for Thomas to swing his axe and attempt to chop wood to complete his first task. I'm making an assumption here that the "swing action" works as a chop tree action in this game or simulation environment. The provided JSON would look like this:
{ "type": "SwingAxe", "data": { "characterId": "A1" } }

[1690325277745]Plan: 
[1690325277745]First, Thomas Smith should execute his priority 1 task, which is to chop the wood. Once this has been completed, his next task is to store the wood in the chest, and his final task is to cook dinner. We can assume that Thomas Smith needs to have successfully completed tasks 1 and 2 before he can cook dinner. Since the "SwingAxe" action does not require moving or changing the environment, Thomas should do this first.

Reasoning:
The first priority task is to chop wood. Therefore, Thomas should take the axe from his inventory that he currently possesses and chop a tree. After chopping, he can collect the wood and store it in his inventory, thus completing the first task. Next, he should move towards the chest and execute the action "AddItemToChest" to store the chopped woods as per the second priority task. As a lumberjack, it's his routine job to chop down trees, store them, and maintain his environment for easy access & safety purposes. He should keep the inventory free for any unexpected task or requirement. Now that wood collection and storage are over, Thomas can now concentrate on cooking dinner, which involves preparation, cooking, and cleaning.

[1690325300478]Plan: 
[1690325300478]As per the character's prioritized tasks, the first task is to chop wood. However, the previous action, Thomas made to chop wood was unsuccessful as his location did not have any trees. Therefore, he needs to move to a location with trees.

Based on his previous memories, it is noted that there were trees around his original position (16 minutes ago). So he should start by moving back to that location. Here, the specific coordinates are not mentioned so we will start by making small movements in the hope to encounter trees.

After he has successfully chopped wood, the next task would be to store the wood in the chest. Since Thomas is already carrying wood, he could start by storing the existing wood he has before moving on to chop more.

The next action will depend on the success of the first action: if Thomas finds trees and successfully chops wood, he should store it in the chest. If not, he must continue moving until he encounters trees.

Finally, Thomas's third task is to cook dinner, which does not need direct action right now.

[1690325313588]Plan: 
[1690325313588]Given that Thomas's inventory consists of an axe and wood, and his current tasks require him to chop wood and store it in a chest, the following sequence of actions can be accomplished:

1. Thomas needs to chop more wood since his inventory currently holds seven pieces, and we are not aware of the quantity required for the task.
2. After chopping wood, he needs to store the wood in the chest. Here, the distance to the chest is minimal (0.1630933m), so it is convenient for Thomas to deposit the wood.
3. The final task is to cook dinner. But as there is no additional information on this task's requirements or attributable actions, we can ignore this for now.

Since the task with the highest priority is to chop wood, Thomas should continue to do so. As his previous attempts to swing the axe haven't hit any trees, he may need to move to another location where trees are guaranteed to be around, or continue swinging the axe in hope of a hit.

Considering the above, the selected action would be to swing the axe again.

[1690325343802]Plan: 
[1690325343802]Based on the tasks given, Thomas needs to chop some more wood as that is his top priority task. After successfully collecting wood, he must store it in the chest which is his second priority. However, before chopping wood, it needs to be confirmed that Thomas is next to a tree as his recent attempts to chop wood were unsuccessful based on the Previous Actions provided. 

Action: 
If Thomas isn't already next to a tree, he needs to move to one before attempting to chop down trees. The precise coordinates of a tree aren't given, so there may need to be multiple attempts until Thomas is successful. Future actions will be planned based on his success in chopping wood.

Given that we don't know if Thomas is currently near a tree, and the coordinates of a tree, the best action would be to attempt to chop wood and adjust his position if necessary.

Chopping wood can be done using the SwingAxe action. The characterId for this action would be "A1" (Thomas's ID).

Here's the JSON object to execute the SwingAxe action:

[1690325364914]Plan: 
[1690325364915]1. Since the "Chop wood" task has the highest priority, and Thomas's axe storage still has room, he should keep chopping wood.
2. Once the axe's storage is full, Thomas should execute the task of "Store wood in chest", by moving to the chest location and depositing the chopped wood.
3. After he successfully stored all the wood, he can then proceed to accomplish his third task, which is "Cook dinner". For this, additional information is required, as the location or the objects needed for cooking aren't specified in the available data.

Given the highest priority task and the recent actions showing unsuccessful attempts at chopping wood, we can infer that Thomas might not be positioned near a tree. Thus, the appropriate action here should be to move closer to the trees.

Reasoning: 
- Thomas should focus on the highest priority task which is "Chop wood".
- As his recent actions indicate unsuccessful attempts at cutting trees, he may need to move closer to the trees.
- The priority-2 task, "Store wood in chest" would only be able to be conducted when the woodcutting starts because his inventory is currently less than full.
- The priority-3 task, "Cook dinner" will only be addressed once the first two tasks are completed.

[1690325394682]Plan: 
[1690325394682]Based on the priority order of the tasks list, Thomas should first chop more wood, despite the tasks not precisely determining how much should be chopped. After that, he should store the chopped wood in the chest which is the second-priority task. Lastly, the third-priority task would be to cook dinner. The exact process and items for the dinner are not determined, but one could assume it would be using the wood for fire.

Reasoning: Although Thomas Smith has plentiful wood in his inventory, it could be that he needs a specific quantity for his tasks. That's why it makes sense to continue with the highest priority task of chopping wood.

Next, he will need to return to deposit the wood in the chest. He had previously deposited wood to a chest at coordinates X: -5.51, Y: -4.46.

After his tasks of chopping and storing wood are complete, he can begin to cook dinner. While the specifics for this task aren't detailed, it is implied that the wood he has been gathering and storing will be used to make a fire for cooking.

Note: It's not clear from the current available actions how to cook dinner. We might need to adapt the plan based on new available actions.

[1690325414528]Plan: 
[1690325414528]1. Move closer to a tree. This is because Thomas Smith's previous axe swings failed to hit any trees, indicating that he might not be close enough to a tree.
2. Swing the axe again in order to chop wood. This will be performed multiple times until enough wood is collected.
3. Move to the chest and deposit the wood. This will be performed each time a sufficient amount of wood is collected.
4. After all wood is collected and stored, Thomas can start cooking dinner.

The first action will be to move closer to a tree. Let's say the coordinates for a tree are X: 6.5, Y: 4.5.

[1690325432732]Plan: 
[1690325432732]Looking at the tasks, the first one is to chop wood, Thomas Smith is currently in the right location to do that, as he is a brave, calm, and an honest lumberjack. Thomas has both the right personality and the right tool (an axe) to carry out the task. This action is in alignment with the first task and can be executed immediately. After carrying out that task, Smith could then move on to the second task which is to store the wood in a chest. Finally, Smith can cook his dinner, which is the last task.

Reasoning:
It would be more logical to complete the first task which is chop more wood. We see that Smith had some unsuccessful attempts (no trees were hit) in his recent actions. Now that he has changed his location, he might be in a position to successfully chop down some trees. Once he has enough wood, he will be able to proceed with the other tasks of storing the wood and cooking dinner.

[1690325448810]Plan: 
[1690325448810]Currently, Thomas Smith has an axe and some wood in his inventory. As his first priority task is to "Chop wood", it seems that he has been unsuccessful in hitting any tree in his recent attempts as recorded in his previous actions. He may be in the wrong location to find the trees. Thus, the immediate task should be to move him towards a location where trees are abundant.

Reasoning: It's clear from the actions that Thomas is not in a location with trees since every time he swings his axe; he's hitting 0 trees. Instead of continuing to waste energy on swinging the axe, Thomas should move to a location where trees are present.

[1690325473193]Given his tasks, Thomas needs to chop some wood. However, wood-chopping attempts in the past minutes haven't been successful as highlighted in the "previous actions" list. Perhaps, the trees in the current location have been completely cut down. We need to move Thomas to a new location with more trees. After he manages to chop more wood, he can store the wood in the chest, and then proceed to cook dinner.

[1690325498962]Plan: 
[1690325498965]Based on the information provided and the list of tasks assigned, the priority would be to continue chopping wood until and unless the inventory is full with 10 wood pieces (as the current capacity used is 8 out of 10). Once the inventory is full, Thomas Smith would then move to storing all the wood pieces into the chest which is nearby (in a distance of 0.6103017m) and subsequently, he would carry out the task of cooking dinner. Since the available actions do not include a "chop wood" action, I will be creating an equivalent action that represents chopping wood.

Reasoning:
As per the task list, the first priority is to chop wood. Thomas Smith already has 1 axe in his inventory and he has been actively using it in the past minutes as per the previous actions log. The second task would be to store the chopped wood in the designated chest. The location of the chest and the character's current location suggest that the chest is nearby as the distance is only about 0.6m. Adhering to the priority list, after chopping and storing wood, the character would then move on to his third task which is to cook dinner. However, since there are no available actions related to cooking, this won't be considered in the final action plan.

Based on my plan, the first possible action would be to chop wood.

[1690325511969]Plan: 
[1690325511969]Given that the highest priority task is to chop wood, Thomas needs to find trees to chop. However, based on the previous actions, Thomas was not able to hit any tree at the locations he swung his axe.

Therefore, Thomas should move to another location where there might be trees.

Following that, the second priority task is to store the chopped wood in the chest. Since Thomas is already carrying 7 pieces of wood, he can store these in the chest.

Thus, the plan should be:
1. Move to another location.
2. Chop wood, if there are trees.
3. Store the wood in the chest.

Now let's move on to pick a suitable action for Thomas. Since no specific coordinates are given for possible tree locations, Thomas could try moving to a randomly chosen location.

[1690325523582]Plan: 
[1690325523583]Considering the tasks and Thomas' current status, the best approach would be to first accomplish task 1 - "Chop wood". This task can be accomplished by using the "SwingAxe" action, which he's done previously according to the memory logs. Once he's chopped enough wood, he can then continue on to task 2 and place the wood in the chest. Cooking dinner will come afterwards, as it is less prioritized.

[1690325546617]Plan: 
[1690325546617]Given that Thomas Smith's current task priorities start with chopping wood, the ideal plan would be -

1. Thomas should move towards trees as the previous attempts at swinging the axe did not hit any trees. This might be due to them being too far from the current location.

2. After chopping the wood, Thomas can store the wood in nearby chest when the inventory is full. This chest is currently quite near him (only 0.6226264m away). So, moving there wouldn't take much effort.

3. He can then cook the dinner which seems like a different kind of task and might not be related to the physical environment mentioned here.

Given the actions available, let's start with moving to an area with trees. For that, we need the specific location (X, Y) of the trees. But since tree coordinates aren't given, we can let Thomas move in a direction based on previous walks and swings. He last moved to X: -6, Y: -5 and swung the axe at X: -5.848157, Y: -4.982794. Let's slightly change the coordinates and try moving in that direction.

[1690325571137]Plan: 
[1690325571137]Looking at the priorities of Thomas Smith's tasks, the first one is to chop wood. However, looking at the previous actions, Thomas appears to have unsuccessfully tried to chop down wood multiple times, and it is unclear if there are more trees around him. As such, it may be beneficial for him to focus on his second priority task first - storing wood in the chest. 

He currently has 7 pieces of wood in his inventory. Our main task would then be to store this wood in the chest - thus helping clear out his inventory.

Reasoning:
"AddItemToChest" action allows Thomas to put items in his inventory into the chest. As the task of storing wood in the chest is of higher priority than cooking dinner (thus assuming he does not immediately need the wood for a fire), it would be more beneficial to store the wood first.

His location is close to the chest's location, so he does not need to move to perform this action. So our action should be to add wood to the chest.

[1690325592858]Plan: 
[1690325592859]Seeing the priorities in the task list, Thomas should be focused on chopping some more wood. However, it's unclear whether there are any trees left in Thomas's vicinity from the provided memory data. To be safe, Thomas should move to a nearby location just in case the current place lacks trees. After moving, Thomas can then swing his axe to chop the wood (assuming there are indeed trees), which then allows him to proceed to his next priority task, storing the wood in the chest.

The chosen action will be to move Thomas to a new location (X, Y) different from his current spot (-5.881376, -4.993819).

[1690325612689]Plan: 
[1690325612689]To accomplish the tasks, the plan could be:
1. Since the task "Chop wood" is of the highest priority, Thomas Smith needs to find a tree and use his axe to chop it.
2. After chopping the wood, according to task 2, Thomas should store the wood in the chest which is just 1.483996m away from him.
3. The third task is "Cook dinner", however, there is no information regarding cooking or an available action to execute this task.

Regarding the available actions, it isn't clear if Thomas can chop a tree, as the previous actions include swinging the axe but without hitting any trees. With the available information, there is no action for chopping a tree listed. So, Thomas can move towards the chest first and prepare for the next step of storing the chopped wood.

So my selected action would be, moving Thomas to the location of the chest.

[1690325630540]Plan: 
[1690325630540]First, Thomas should complete his first priority task, which is to chop wood. Since he already has an axe and is in an environment with trees, he should use the SwingAxe action to chop wood. There is no need to move as there is no specified tree to chop. After collecting the chopped wood, he should then proceed to deposit it in the chest as per the second priority task. This will be done through the AddItemToChest action, depositing the collected wood into the nearby chest. Lastly, although the action to cook dinner isn't available directly, it's presumed that Thomas will complete this task later when he has the necessary tools and materials.

[1690325649471]Plan: 
[1690325649471]1. As per the priorities, Thomas needs to chop wood first. As the axe is already in the inventory, no need to fetch that.
2. Post chopping, he needs to store the wood in the chest. Thomas is already near the chest, so no need to move there.
3. Lastly, he needs to cook dinner. However, there are no actions available related to cooking at this moment. 

Given these, Thomas should first perform the "Chop wood" task, and then the "Store wood in chest" task.

In order to accomplish the tasks, Thomas should execute the 'SwingAxe' task from the 'Available Actions'. The SwingAxe action has the potential to yield wood which can be stored in the chest. After getting some wood, Thomas should execute the 'AddItemToChest' action to put the wood into the chest.

[1690325672015]Plan: 
[1690325672015]Firstly, Thomas needs to find a tree to chop as his first task is to chop wood but he's swinging at an empty location right now. Secondly, he needs to store that collected wood into the chest following his second task. Finally, Thomas needs to cook dinner but we don't have information whether he can cook or on what he can cook in the current environment.

Action 1: Move to a location with trees.
Action 2: After reaching the location with trees, Thomas should use his axe using 'SwingAxe' action to chop wood.
Action 3: Once he has wood acquired from chopping a tree, he should store this wood in the chest using 'AddItemToChest' action. 
Action 4: Thomas can cook his dinner once he has completed the two above tasks. Details on how to cook dinner are missing.

[1690325685732]Plan: 
[1690325685732]Given that the first piece of task that Thomas Smith needs to complete is 'Chop wood', the best action to follow would be to find a tree and swing the axe at it. However, based on previous actions, he seems to always hit 0 trees whenever he swings the axe. This might imply that he's standing in a location without any surrounding trees. Therefore, before attempting to chop wood, Thomas should perhaps first move to a location where trees are present. The system does not provide information on where these trees might be located. After successfully chopping some wood, Thomas can then move on to the second task, 'Store wood in chest', by returning to the chest at X: -5.51, Y: -4.46. For now, without the specified location of trees, a possible next best action for Thomas would be to explore the current environment hoping to find some trees.

[1690325710436]Plan: 
[1690325710436]Given the tasks and their priority, the best course of action is to first chop more wood, and then store it in the chest. Cooking dinner is the final task but, we don't currently have the necessary resources to cook dinner, as there is no food or fire mentioned. Furthermore, Thomas has already been chopping wood and it is directly relevant to task one.

As the character is already equipped with an axe, Thomas can use it to chop more wood. After more wood has been gathered, the character can then go to the chest (at X: -5.51, Y: -4.46) and add the wood to the chest. Chopping more wood is currently the highest priority and movement actions were recently performed, so it is inferred that the character is in the vicinity of a tree suitable for chopping. 

Given the integration above, Thomas should execute a [ChopWood] action. However, this action isn't in the available action list, likely meaning that he must find a more suitable chopping target. As such, the best available action, given the information, would be to execute a [MoveTo] action to find a tree to chop.

[1690325729336]Plan: 
[1690325729336]Based on the tasks priorities, Thomas needs to chop wood since this is the highest priority task. However, he already has some wood in his inventory. The wood in his inventory also doesn't meet the max limit. This indicates that Thomas should first keep the chopped wood in the chest before continuing to chop more wood.

Steps:

1. Firstly, Thomas should move closer to the chest. The chest is not far off with just 1.961032m distance. 
2. Then Thomas should store the wood in the chest. After storing the wood, some space will be freed in the inventory making it available to hold more chopped wood. 
3. After this, Thomas can go back to chopping more wood.

Action:

Based on the reasoning above, my first action will be moving closer to the chest. Thomas will only be able to store the wood in the chest if he is close to it.

[1690325738185]Plan: 
[1690325738185]Given his current location and the priorities of his tasks, Thomas Smith should continue chopping wood, then storing it in the chest, before considering preparing dinner. Although the chest is approximately 1.961032 metres away, there is no need to move closer as interactions with the chest have been successful from the current position.

Next Action:
The first task is to chop wood. Given that "SwingAxe" is no longer listed as an available action, implying it doesn't need to be targeted at something or initiated from a certain position, Thomas Smith should deposit any hardwood he has in his inventory into the nearby chest to free up space.

[1690325768869]Looking at Thomas's tasks, the highest priority task is to chop wood. He possesses an axe and is already in an outdoor location likely containing trees. Thomas's previous actions also show he has been successfully chopping and depositing wood, so he should continue with this action.

Once enough wood has been chopped (keeping in mind inventory limitation), he should then store the wood in the chest based on his second priority task. This action repeats until the chopping wood task is complete.

Cooking dinner isn't exactly possible based on current available actions, but we can infer that it may require gathering more wood for a fire and possibly locating a source of food.

Since the first task is to continue chopping wood, the action should be to "SwingAxe" at a tree.

[1690325799520]Plan: 
[1690325799520]1. Thomas Smith's current priority is to chop wood, but his attempts to swing his axe at his current location have not hit any trees. Therefore, he need to move to a location with trees before he can successfully chop wood. However, the information provided does not include the location of any trees.
2. After chopping wood, Thomas Smith needs to store the wood in a chest. Because he currently has an axe in his inventory, he should be able to carry more wood after chopping. The chest is located at X: -5.51, Y: -4.46 and is 1.462238m away — a short distance for Thomas Smith to walk. As such, he does not need to do anything related to the chest right now.
3. Thomas also needs to cook dinner, but there is no information on where or how to do this, so it cannot be considered in the current action plan.

Given that there is no information about the location of any trees, the best action for Thomas Smith to take right now is to move to a different location and try to find trees. However, the information provided does not include any locations that are guaranteed to have trees. Therefore, it seems the best option is to make an educated guess based on the environment. The deposits of stone and coal ore are to the positive Y direction from Thomas Smith, so there might be trees in that direction as well. As a result, he should move to a location that is further in the positive Y direction. For example, he could move to his current location plus 1 unit in the Y direction, while keeping his X coordinate the same.

[1690325818643]Plan: 
[1690325818643]Thomas Smith's first priority carries the task "Chop wood". For that, Thomas needs to find a tree. Once he finds a tree, he can use his axe from inventory to chop the wood. Then he can do the second task that stores the chopped wood in the chest, which is around 2.3m distant from him. After depositing the wood, Thomas can focus on his third task "Cook dinner", however, there is no information about the cooking materials or location so it's a bit difficult to plan for that at the moment.

However, since there is no tree in the environment and no action to search for a tree, the priority should be to drop the wood which will reduce Thomas's inventory which is almost at capacity. This will then allow Thomas to pick up other items which could be useful to him.

Let's take the action to drop the wood from inventory to the ground in preparation for carrying out Thomas's tasks in the future.

So, the best course of action would be to walk to the chest and store the wood. Later, he can chop more wood if needed.

[1690325845070]Plan: 
[1690325845070]Given Thomas Smith's tasks include chopping wood and storing wood in the chest, the first action would be to chop more wood. After acquiring enough wood, he would then deposit the wood into the nearby chest. Given his current standing, Thomas doesn't need to move anywhere for the first task as his swing can interact with his environment without needing to move to a specific target location. However, to deposit the wood, he would need to move close to the chest which should be achievable with MoveTo action.

[1690325869133]Plan: 
[1690325869133]As mentioned in the tasks assignment, Thomas has to chop some wood, store the chopped wood in the chest, and then cook dinner. From previous actions, we can deduce that the trees are probably out of reach since his last "SwingAxe" action hit no trees. Therefore, Thomas has to locate or move to a location where trees are available for chopping. After chopping the wood, he can deposit it in his nearby chest. The dinner task seems unrelated to any other tasks or actions and may require a different set of actions.

Here is a proposed action:
First, Thomas Smith will need to move closer to a tree. The last location where he hit trees is not mentioned, but we'll assume it's close to the chest and away from his current location. He'll need to move toward X: -5.01, Y: -4.01, which seems like the past direction of successful tree chopping endeavors. After this, he will execute his "SwingAxe" action to chop wood and gather the resources needed for his tasks. Note: this requires multiple turns and is not achievable in the current turn.

[1690325884949]Plan: 
[1690325884949]First, Thomas needs to complete his highest priority task which is "Chop wood". Since he has an axe in his inventory, the best thing to do would be to locate a tree that he can chop. After chopping the necessary amount of wood, he should then complete his second task which is "Store wood in chest". He is already quite close to the chest and all he needs to do is move to the chest and store the wood. His final task is to "Cook dinner" which doesn't seem to be possible with the current inventory and actions available. 

However, our available actions list does not provide a way to chop trees. Given the current circumstance, the best course of action would be to move towards the chest to be ready to store the wood once he has chopped it.

[1690325911045]Plan: 
[1690325911045]Thomas Smith's high priority task is to chop wood, as he is a lumberjack. Well, he already has 5 pieces of wood in his inventory. He doesn't need more wood as he can't carry more than 10 items at once in his inventory. His next task is to store wood in the chest. The chest is in close proximity (0.1611571m away). Therefore, Thomas should add the wood from his inventory to the chest.

Next, Thomas needs to cook dinner. However, there are no available actions related to this task at the moment, therefore Thomas can attempt to complete this task at a later time.

[1690325933564]Plan: 
[1690325933564]Given the list of tasks, Thomas Smith's current priority is to chop wood. Since there are no trees in his immediate hitbox, he will need to move to a location where there are trees. Unfortunately, the current set of data does not provide the location of nearby trees. Therefore, Thomas must move around to find a tree, chop it, and add the resulting wood to his inventory.

After gathering enough wood, his next task is to store the wood in the chest. To accomplish this, he needs to move to the chest's location. Thankfully, the chest is in his vicinity based on the Environment data. He can deposit the wood he has gathered into this chest.

After storing the wood, he can start cooking his dinner. We'll see the specifics of this action when the time comes.

Given the limited data available and keeping the prioritized tasks in mind, the first appropriate action would be to move Thomas to a new location in search of trees.

[1690325948344]Thomas Smith should first complete his highest priority task. According to his task list, chopping wood is his top priority, followed by storing the wood in the chest, and finally cooking dinner. Assuming that Thomas has no wood left to be chopped around his current location because there is no indication of trees nearby, then he should prioritize the second task, which is storing wood in the chest. He currently holds 4 units of wood, and there is a chest within a distance that is not far at all (0.1961572m). Therefore, Thomas should move to the chest and deposit the wood into it.

[1690325965329]Plan: 
[1690325965329]According to Thomas's task list, the highest priority task is to chop wood. However, his previous actions indicate unsuccessful attempts to chop wood. It seems like there's no tree in his vicinity that he could chop.

Therefore, the best course of action would likely be to move to another location where there might be trees. This would fall under the MoveTo action. A specific location isn't provided so any reasonable coordinates can be chosen.

Once he moved to a new location, he could then attempt to chop wood again. If successful, he could then store the wood in his chest. Finally, for his third task, he would need to gather more supplies or use items from his inventory to cook dinner.

[1690325986493]Plan: 
[1690325986494]Thomas Smith's top priority task is to 'chop wood', for which he already has an axe required. Once the wood is chopped, he can store it in the nearby chest as per his second priority task. As of now, there is no information related to third task of 'cooking dinner', so we can focus on the first two.

Action Plan:
1. Chop wood until inventory fills up or enough wood is collected for later tasks (Task 1).
2. Move to the nearby chest (as its distance is only 0.5108918m away, but Smith may do this automatically).
3. Deposit wood into the chest to free up inventory space and to accomplish Task 2.

However, there seems to be no available actions to chop wood. The only available actions to interact with items in the inventory and move around in the environment. Therefore, the action I would choose at this point is for Thomas Smith to move towards the wood. But there is also no info about the specific location of trees/wood. So, under these circumstances I can't choose a valid action. I would either wait for more recent data or for actions to be available.

[1690326006269]Plan: 
[1690326006270]Thomas Smith's top priority task is to chop wood. Given the fact that his inventory doesn't show any chopped wood, it implies that he hasn't chopped any more recently. Therefore, he should proceed to chop wood first. 

Once Thomas has chopped enough wood, he can then perform the task of storing the wood in the chest which is the second priority task. The chest is not that far from his current location. He can then add the chopped wood to this chest.

Lastly, the task of cooking dinner is his lowest priority. Given the availability of actions and tasks at hand, it's assumed that he would need to chop and collect enough firewood for the task. 

The selected action will be encouraging Thomas Smith to chop wood. Since the available actions don't include chopping wood, it's assumed that this action can be performed automatically by the system, or that a different action from the available actions could implicitly include chopping wood. 

Even though we don't know the underlying gameplay mechanics, an assumption could be that "SwingAxe" action in the system might implicitly include chopping wood. 

Given this, in order to provide a specific action, it would be towards moving Thomas closer to the chest first, so that he spends less time moving around after chopping the wood.

[1690326025275]Plan: 
[1690326025275]1. Check the inventory, Thomas has enough wood, so doesn't need to chop more wood.
2. The next task is to store wood in the chest, move to the chest and store the wood.
3. Based on recent memories, the chest appears to be within walking distance, so movement should be relatively quick.
4. Once the wood is stored, proceed with the task of cooking dinner.

Reasoning: Given Thomas Smith's memories and recent actions, as well as his current inventory and tasks, it would be the most efficient to head straight to the chest to store the wood and then get started on cooking dinner. There seems to be no immediate need to chop more wood or interact with the environment in any other way.

[1690326038867]The first task of Thomas is to chop wood. However, his inventory item shows he already has 4 woods. Considering his priority tasks, he should first store the collected wood in the chest as his inventory is half full already.

[1690326063167]Plan: 
[1690326063170]Given Thomas Smith's task list and available actions, my plan would be for him to chop wood (Task 1), store the wood in the chest (Task 2), and then his final task is to cook dinner, which indicates there must be a fire or cooking place nearby that has not been mentioned in the set we have deciphered.

Step 1: I would have Thomas Smith chop more wood. Chopping wood should use the SwingAxe action, which will hopefully result in more wood, moving us closer to complete Task 1.

Step 2: Thomas should store the obtained wood in the chest, utilising the AddItemToChest action, thereby removing the wood from his inventory and adding it to the chest's inventory.

Step 3: As it is currently not clear where Thomas should go to cook dinner, he would presumably move closer to a nearby fire or cooking location once he has finished chopping and storing wood.

For this step, we'll choose the action SwingAxe to accomplish Task 1, Chop Wood.

[1690326084294]Plan: 
[1690326084294]1. Thomas's first task is to chop wood. Since he already carries an axe in his inventory, the step would be to find the nearest tree and swing the axe to chop it.
2. After chopping sufficient wood, he will move to the chest to deposit the wood, thus accomplishing his second task.
3. For the third task, it is not clear what needs to be done as there is no cooking option in the available actions. Also, no indication of a kitchen area is specified in the environment. However, we will assume that completing the first two tasks will lead to unlocking the necessary steps for the third task.
4. As there is no tree mentioned within Thomas's hitbox range, it can be inferred that he needs to move to a new location in order to find a tree to chop.

[1690326103163]Plan: 
[1690326103164]Firstly, Thomas needs to chop wood, for which he'll need to find a tree. There are no trees currently visible in his surroundings, so he'll have to move to a new location. Once he has chopped enough wood, he should move on to his second task which is to store the wood in the chest. The chest's coordinates are already given by default, so he can move to that location when it's time. Once he's done storing the wood, he can cook dinner. We don't know whether Thomas has the necessary ingredients or equipment to cook dinner, so he might need to gather these beforehand.

[1690326120937]Plan: 
[1690326120939]Looking at all the tasks, the first priority task for Thomas is to chop wood, whereas the second priority task is to store wood in the chest. 

Thus, given that Thomas is currently not near to any trees (as none are listed in the environment), the first action should be to find a tree to chop. However, there are no movement options given to a location with a tree. 
This suggests that I should ask Thomas to drop the axe he is holding, which is preventing him from doing anything else since he cannot move freely with it. Once the axe has been dropped, more actions (including movement options to a tree) should appear, and Thomas should be able to start completing his tasks.

[1690326140216]Plan: 
[1690326140216]Thomas Smith has a task to chop more wood, store it in the chest, and cook dinner. Currently, he dropped his axe, which is essential for chopping wood, and he's near the axe. Hence, the first immediate action is to pick up the Axe. After this, he should find a tree to cut for wood, put the newly chopped wood into his inventory, and then move to the chest to store the acquired wood. The cooking dinner task might require additional information not currently available, like a campfire or ingredients. However, we should focus on prior tasks for the moment. 

The first action that Thomas should perform is picking up the Axe.

[1690326149812]Plan: 
[1690326149812]Based on the tasks Thomas Smith has, he should move to the Axe, pick it up and then move to a tree to start chopping it for wood. The priority of the tasks informs this decision, as chopping wood is ranked as the highest priority. Then he can move to the chest with the retrieved wood and store it there. However, there are no trees in his current environment which might be a mistake or the trees might be out of his sight. Therefore, the best action for now is to move to the axe, pick it up and wait for further environment updates.

[1690326172669]Plan: 
[1690326172669]The first task to be accomplished is to chop the wood and Thomas doesn't have a tool currently to chop the wood since he has dropped it on the ground recently. So, we should first make Thomas to walk towards the coordinates X: -0.9168212, Y: 0.866604 to pick up the axe.

Reasoning:

The closest important object to Thomas (available from the environment description) is the axe he dropped at coordinates X: -0.9168212, Y: 0.866604. 

This is a necessary object for task completion and is about 0.062 m away (which is considerably closer than the other objects described in the environment).

After retrieving the axe, Thomas will be able to resume his tasks, and specifically the priority-one task of chopping wood.

[1690326190652]Plan: 
[1690326190652]1. Assess the situation: The primary task is to chop wood. Given that Thomas is a lumberjack and he has an axe, this is within his abilities. He has wood already in his inventory so no immediate action is needed.
2. Move towards the wood deposit. Thomas is closest to the stone ore deposit, but he doesn't need stones for any of his tasks. Therefore he can ignore this location. The chest should also be ignored at this point, since the second task is to store wood in it, but he has not yet chopped any new wood to store.
3. Chop the wood. Once he has reached the wood deposit, he should chop wood until his inventory is full (maximum 10 items, he currently has 4, so he has space for 6 more pieces of wood).
4. Transfer wood to the chest. Once his inventory is full, he should move to the chest and transfer all the wood from his inventory to the chest.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until all tasks are completed.

[1690326207734]Plan: 
[1690326207734]First, Thomas needs to chop wood as that's the highest priority task right now. Once he's finished with that, if he has enough wood he can carry, he needs to store it in the chest, which is the second priority task. If his inventory is filled up with more wood than he can carry after chopping, he might need to drop some on the ground before moving to the chest. After these two tasks are tackled, then he can focus on cooking dinner. 

As a first step, he should approach the tree to start chopping. After accumulating enough wood, the next step is to locate the chest and deposit the wood. As for cooking dinner, there needs to be more information regarding the location of his cooking supplies or if he has them in his inventory to begin with.

Given the available information, pick the best available action to accomplish your tasks. Respond in JSON: { type: [ActionType], data: {characterId optional parameters}}. Please note that if an action is in the available items list, you can execute it immediately, without needing to change or move. First you should list your reasoning and create a plan, and then using that plan, select an action and create a JSON object for that action with the necessary info. The JSON object must be immediately after "Action: " as we're using regex to parse it.

[1690326232856]Plan: 
[1690326232856]1. First prioritize the task of chopping wood.
2. Swing Axe towards the nearest tree or wood. If there is no visible tree, then move to a location where trees might be, given Thomas Smith's previous observations with trees and stumps.
3. Store chopped wood in the chest. If chest is not visually available then Thomas Smith may need to remember its location and move towards that.
4. Cook dinner.

Reasoning:

Given Thomas's current location, there are only Ore Deposits available and not any trees. It is also worth noting that his hitbox currently includes a Stone Ore Deposit, hence there might be a possibility to chop that. However, since his priority is to chop wood and not ore deposit, Thomas needs to move near trees or stumps. His previous encounters imply a forested environment where it's likely to find trees.

[1690326247038]Plan: 
[1690326247038]Since the primary task is to chop wood and we have an axe in the inventory, the best course of action would be to swing the axe. Age doesn't seem to be a factor because Thomas is young and healthy. Therefore, environmental factors like the location of wood and its type should be considered. The availability of objects to hit with a swing based action suggests that we are close to a stone ore deposit and not a tree. Therefore, it would be wise to move closer to image of a tree for chopping wood, since there aren't any details about the specific locations of trees.

[1690326269838]Plan: 
[1690326269838]Looking at the available tasks and actions, Thomas needs to prioritize chopping wood since it's the task with the highest priority. His inventory shows he has an axe so we don't need to retrieve that first to begin the chopping task. However, the recent action doesn't show any successful attempt at chopping wood, so we might need to move to a location with trees. Unfortunately, there are no trees listed in the "environment" section or the "hitbox." Without being able to spot a tree, we cannot proceed with the chopping task. Therefore, Thomas needs to move to try and find one.

The available actions show Thomas can move to a specific target location. But as the exact coordinates of a tree aren't provided, we can only make an arbitrary choice for a new location.

It is essential to take into account that each move costs a unit of energy or resource, so making moves aimlessly would not be efficient. Observing the current environment's items (ore deposits), we can infer that this might be a mining area, and common sense suggests that trees might be harder to find in such a region. With no reliable way of determining where trees could be spawned in this environment, a feasible strategy would be to move towards a location where trees are conventionally found - perhaps a less rocky or mountainous terrain.

Thus, a reasonable action would be to arbitrarily move to a new location in search of trees.

[1690326289385]Plan: 
[1690326289386]Based on the tasks array, the first task for Thomas is to chop wood. We can see in his inventory that he already has an axe which is required for this task. However, to chop wood he needs to find trees. The available actions do not show any option to interact with trees. So, one probable action would be for him to move around and hopefully find a tree that he can chop down.

Another fact to consider is the past memories show Thomas has interacted with a chest. One of the tasks was also to store wood in a chest. But there's no chest in his current environment, so moving around might also reveal the chest again. 

Considering these factors, an advisable action would be to move to a certain location. Although the new location is not known, the final decision should be to move around.

[1690326303662]Plan: 
[1690326303662]The first task in priority is to chop wood. From the environment's description, there's no wood or trees indicated. However, Thomas has an axe in his inventory. My assumption is that either more of the environment needs to be explored to find wood to chop or a "SwingAxe" action needs to be performed and it could result in wood cutting. Also, since the hitbox shows we're currently near a Coal Ore Deposit and a Stone Ore Deposit, I would hypothesize that the "SwingAxe" action may actually interact with these items instead. To check this hypothesis, it's logical to use the "SwingAxe" action.

[1690326313022]Based on the tasks, Thomas Smith needs to first chop wood before storing and cooking dinner. Since he has wood in his inventory and no trees are within range to chop, his next task is to go to the chest to store his collected wood.

[1690326334682]Plan: 
[1690326334682]Thomas Smith currently has three tasks: chopping wood, storing wood in the chest, and cooking dinner. Apparently, he has an axe to chop wood and some wood that he has already chopped. In addition, he has a chest that is close to him that was previously used to store wood. 

Since high priority is given to chopping wood, Thomas should probably continue with that task until he has enough wood. Then he can move onto the task of storing the wood in the chest. It's not yet known how Thomas will cook dinner, as no relevant items or actions have appeared yet.

Given that his current environment is an outdoor area with trees, it seems reasonable to assume that Thomas can chop more wood. Therefore, the optimal action for Thomas right now is to swing his axe and chop some wood. 

After chopping the wood, he can then drop the chopped wood from his inventory and store them in the chest.

[1690326349018]Plan: 
[1690326349018]First, since Thomas Smith has just chopped a tree and there is no indication that the tree has actually vanished from his environment, Thomas should strike at the same spot to finish chopping the tree. After chopping the tree, Thomas can add the wood to his inventory. According to the tasks list, after chopping the wood, Thomas must store it in the chest. Given that Thomas is already at the chest's coordinates, placing the wood into the chest should be straightforward. Lastly, he should 'Cook Dinner,' but the action to complete this task is not provided in the current information.

[1690326372414]Plan: 
[1690326372414]The character has three tasks with different priorities. 
- The first task is "Chop wood". The character has an axe, and can swing it to chop wood. 
- The second task is "Store wood in chest". The character currently has a good supply (3 units) of wood. The chest's location is known, and the character can deposit this wood. 
- The third task is "Cook dinner". 

Given that the 'AddItemToChest' action is in the list of available actions, I recommend that we execute 'AddItemToChest' after reasoning through the character's priorities.

Reasoning: 
- Even though "Chop wood" has the highest priority, I assume that since he already has 3 units of wood, which may be considered sufficient, he can delay this task. If necessary, this task can be executed later, since the task only requires the character to chop wood, not gather a certain quantity.
- Compared to "Chop wood", "Store wood in chest" is more urgent. The closest approximation is the 'AddItemToChest' action, making this an ideal action to perform.
- The task "Cook dinner" hasn't been closely analyzed yet, but it seems lower priority than the other tasks at this moment.

[1690326396986]Plan: 
[1690326396986]Firstly, Thomas will complete priority task "Chop wood" until he has a full stack (10) of wood in inventory. To perform this action, he will use the 'SwingAxe' action. Once completing the task, he will move to the next priority task which is "Store wood in chest", to perform this action, he will use 'AddItemToChest'. The location for the chest (X-5.51, Y -4.46) is already available.

Reasoning: From the list of tasks provided, the chopping wood has the highest priority. There is no information provided on how much wood a single chop action gathers, but we proceed with the assumption that it can vary. He has two pieces of wood and his inventory has the maximum capacity of 10 items. If we assume that each chop action yields one wood item, he will need to perform 8 successful 'SwingAxe' actions to fill his inventory. After accomplishing the task of collecting a full stack of wood, he can then proceed with his next high priority task of storing wood in the chest. This is accomplished using the 'AddItemToChest' action.
