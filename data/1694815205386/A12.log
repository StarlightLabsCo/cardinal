Cedric recalls that there might be a property for sale near the Wisdom Oak tree. This information could be of significant value to George and push him closer to his goal. Also, the house's proximity to the Wisdom Oak tree aligns with George's temperament and aspirations - quiet, meditative, and rooted in nature and history, much like the tree itself. Thus, Cedric concludes that sharing this information with George would indeed be making progress towards his aim.

It was built with love and care, like every home in our village. The winds singing through the branches of the old oak would be your lullaby. I believe it could be just what you're looking for.
