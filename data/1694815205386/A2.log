[1694815277554] [35m[CORTEX] George Brown - Plan: [39m George is planning to have a deep conversation with Cedric Warborn about the recent happenings in the village. He might also discuss their work in the mines, his ambitions for a house near the village, and possibly share the secret knowledge of the hidden tunnels. Additionally, sharing a traditional mining song or two might also be part of the conversation.

[1694815306364] [35m[CORTEX] George Brown - Explain: [39mGeorge Brown made no progress towards his goal of catching up with Cedric Warborn about life in the village and discussing any recent events today. However, he did manage to engage in a philosophical conversation with Cedric about the transient nature of life, which might deepen their bond as colleagues and friends. Despite the lack of progress on his specific goal, George would consider this interaction valuable, as maintaining good relations with his fellow miners is a high priority for him.
