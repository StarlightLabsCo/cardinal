[1691880996020] [36m[CORTEX] Character 2 - Say: [39mHi Eli! You're right, these forests hold a whole world of mystery within them, and I certainly don't mind an adventure every now and then. But at the same time, I also find solace in tasks like mining and chopping trees. They keep me connected to the land and the resources that our village depends on. So in a way, whether I'm exploring this stunning wilderness or fulfilling my duties in the village, I see value and joy in both.
