[1691989282055] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Plan: [39m Confront Eli Green about his oppressive leadership and gather the villagers to revolt against him. Reach out to allies outside the village for assistance. Ensure safety of the villagers throughout this process.
[1691989284698] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Say: [39mI am planning to confront Eli Green about his tyranny. We the villagers will not tolerate his oppression any longer.

[1691989292873] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Feel: [39mI feel threatened but resolute in my resolve to end this tyranny
[1691989305651] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Explain: [39mDespite the threats and intimidation, my resolve is only stronger. It is a clear indication that Eli Green feels threatened by our unity and our collective courage. This is undeniably a step towards our goal. His reign of oppression is wavering, and soon, we shall reclaim our village from his iron grasp. I feel that we are making progress, however insignificant it may appear now. Each daring step towards open defiance of his oppressive rule, each rallying cry for freedom, is a chip in the monolith of his tyranny. It may seem monumental in its scope, but even mountains can be worn down by the determined drizzle of resistance. Despite the risks involved, we are decisively progressing towards our goal.
[1691989307052] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Did I make progress? [39m[choice=yes]

[1691989316488] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Plan: [39m Gather support from the villagers who hold the same sentiments against Eli Green. Mobilize them for a peaceful protest against the oppressive regime. Reach out to outside allies and inform them about the situation in the village and rally their support. Also, devise a safety plan for the villagers in case the confrontation with Green turns violent.
[1691989319036] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Say: [39mIt's time for us to rise against Eli Green's tyranny. Let's rally all our allies and prepare for a peaceful protest. We must ensure everyone's safety during this process.

[1691989327859] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Feel: [39mI feel more determined than ever to take a stand against Eli Green's tyranny despite his threats.
[1691989339684] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Explain: [39mEli Green's increased hostility and threats have only underlined the urgency of our cause. This resistance, the rising momentum of our protest, clearly agitates and frightens him. While no substantial changes in the village have been made yet, this emotional upheaval from Green and the fact that we have started to plan our resistance is already a small victory on its own. We have made our voices heard; we have disrupted the rhythm of his tyranny. This, in itself, signifies progress. However, there are still strides to be made. Gaining momentum within the village and securing external support remain pressing tasks. Nonetheless, Eli Green's heightened defensiveness is a telling sign that we are inching closer to our goal of shaking his oppressive grip on the village.

Meanwhile, reach out to external allies for help if needed. Prioritize the safety of the villagers in all stages of this plan.
[1691989349012] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Say: [39mWe must stand strong and united in the face of Eli Green's tyranny. Let's organize a meeting to address our concerns, making sure our safety is not compromised.
