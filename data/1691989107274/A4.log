[1691989274147] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Plan: [39m to understand the heritage and current issues faced by the village through a conversation with Will Turner. In addition, Lucy plans to know more about Will Turner's life, his views, and his connection with the village.
[1691989276089] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Say: [39mGood day, Will. How's everything on your end?

[1691989285440] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Feel: [39mI feel amused hearing about Will's first day in the mines and intrigued by his ability to find positivity in difficult situations.
[1691989292690] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Explain: [39mI have made minor progress towards my goal. Though I got a sense of Will's positive attitude towards his work and a glimpse into his day at the mines, I still need to gather more detailed information about the heritage and current issues faced by the village. His experiences and perceptions can provide valuable insight into these matters. Additionally, understanding Will on a deeper level is necessary to create a comprehensive understanding of the village and its occupants.
[1691989293902] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Did I make progress? [39m[choice=yes]
[1691989295441] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Did I accomplish my goal? [39m[choice=no]
[1691989299536] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Plan: [39m to ask Will Turner more about his experiences in the mines and subtly steer the conversation towards the topic of the villageâ€”its history, current issues, and Will's personal life and perceptions about the village.
[1691989306322] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Say: [39mBreaking a pickaxe on your first day, huh? I'm sure that'll be a story for the tavern! The forest's been kind to us lumberjacks lately, although 'Whisper' could use some sharpening. Tell me Will, what do you make of our village? Have you noticed anything of interest or concern in the time you've been here?

[1691989322579] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Feel: [39mI feel relieved to hear that the village has been supportive towards Will and it reassures me about the solidarity of our community, but I'm also aware that Will's perspective is still fresh and potentially limited.
[1691989330334] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Explain: [39mI did get some information about the village from Will's perspective. It seems he views our community positively and hasn't noticed any major issues so far. However, his views are still formed from a limited experience, so they might not encompass everything about the village's heritage and current challenges. Even though I haven't fully achieved the goal yet, I have made some progress.
[1691989331581] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Did I make progress? [39m[choice=yes]
[1691989332863] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Did I accomplish my goal? [39m[choice=choice=no]
[1691989338499] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Plan: [39m to continue the conversation, keeping it casual and focusing on Will. Lucy plans to ask a subtle, yet direct question about Will's life before coming to the village. Additionally, she is considering sharing some of her own experiences as a lumberjack in the village to encourage Will to do the same.
[1691989344744] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Say: [39mJust a bit of curiosity, Will. As someone who has lived here most of my life, I am interested in how others perceive our village, especially newcomers. We all have a stake in the village's wellbeing after all. By the way, if you donâ€™t mind me asking, what was your life like before coming here?
