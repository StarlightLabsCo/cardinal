[1691986631035] [36m[CORTEX] Character 2 - Say: [39mHi Will! I can only imagine how tough it must have been, but it's great to hear that you found it invigorating. Don't worry about the pickaxe, those things happen, especially in the beginning. Every experience, even the challenging ones, are great learning opportunities. Just stay curious and eager like you always are!
