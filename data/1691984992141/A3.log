[1691986610750] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Plan: [39m To continue his mining training, gain more experience and improve his skills. He is also planning to replace the pickaxe he broke on his first day.
[1691986615775] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Say: [39mHi Lucy, today was my first day in the mines. It was tough but invigorating. I even broke a pickaxe. Can you believe that? I think I have a lot to learn.

[1691986634984] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Feel: [39mI feel encouraged and understood by Lucy's supportive words. It also feels good to know that even the challenges I faced were normal and part of the mining journey.
[1691986644978] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Explain: [39mEven though it was my first day, I already feel like I've learned so much. Breaking the pickaxe was a mistake, yes, but Lucy's right, those things happen, especially in the beginning. I didn't let it discourage me. Instead, I took it as a lesson to be more careful and mindful in the future. I think it's a step towards becoming a better miner. I can't wait for tomorrow to continue my training and learn more.
