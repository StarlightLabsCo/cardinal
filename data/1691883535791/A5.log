[1691883594126] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Plan: [39m To explore the old abandoned house on the edge of the village, to map out the stars from the secret clearing for navigating, and to gather more stories from the villagers about the forest and its creatures.
[1691883598967] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Say: [39mHi Thomas! How have you been? I was just on my way to explore the old abandoned house on the edge of the village. Do you remember any stories about it? I am also trying to map out the stars from my secret clearing for better navigation. Do you know anything about the stars? Lastly, I would like to gather more stories from you about the forest and its creatures. Can't wait to hear your tales!

[1691883620996] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Feel: [39mI feel extremely excited and curious to hear more about the old house, the stars, and the forest creatures, and I look forward to tomorrow night's gathering with the elders to hear their tales.
[1691883628594] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Explain: [39mI definitely made progress towards my goal today. I got a lot of new and exciting information from Thomas about the abandoned house, which gave me more inspiration to explore it. I also learned how to use the North Star for navigation - that's going to prove invaluable for my night expeditions! And hearing about the creatures of the forest, particularly the Timber wolves and the Elk, has filled my imagination with amazing images. Best of all, tomorrow's gathering with the village elders will give me even more stories and knowledge about our local environment. I can't wait!
