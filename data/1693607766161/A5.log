[1693607855851] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Explain: [39mEli would love to assist with chopping wood for the campfire. It serves as another adventure for him, getting to work with his hands in nature. Plus, it provides a great opportunity for him to continue his conversation with Thomas Smith and build their friendship. Chopping wood might not be as glamorous as climbing trees or listening to the stories of the forest, but it's necessary for the village's survival, a duty Eli takes seriously. This could become a new chapter in Eli's story, a chapter of camaraderie and contributing to his community.
