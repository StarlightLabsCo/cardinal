[1691991490768] [36m[CORTEX] Character 2 - Plan: [39mI'm planning to start at the campsite, exploring the area for any safety concerns. I'll check on any signs of unusual wildlife activity or campfire remains. Next, I'll head to the Nume River for a water level assessment, making notes of any significant changes from the last visit. After that, a hike up to the surrounding mountains to observe their wildlife will be on the agenda. Once that's done, I will visit Thomas Smith to discuss village safety and our mutual responsibility in keeping our community safe. A quick observation of a notable tree and a visit to the lumberyard should round out the day.

The mountains are next on the list for wildlife and water assessment. After all that, I'll speak with Thomas Smith about village safety. Remember, we all have a part in keeping our village safe.
