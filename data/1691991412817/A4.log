[1691991458638] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Plan: [39m Lucy plans to catch up with old friend Will Turner. She wants to inquire about his wellbeing and share some interesting stories from her life in the forest. She is also planning to teach him some useful lumberjack skills, if he shows interest.
[1691991460868] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Say: [39mHello Will! It's been a while. How are you doing these days?

[1691991474682] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Feel: [39mI feel relieved hearing that Will is doing well and is enjoying his work at the mines.
[1691991482152] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Explain: [39mI believe I have managed to reconnect with Will Turner successfully. The first part of my goal has been achieved: to catch up with Will and check on his well-being. Hearing about his work in the mines and that he is content with it makes me feel relieved. He seems to be doing well and that was one of my primary concerns. Yet, my total goal isn't reached. I still have to share my tales from the forest and offer to teach him about lumberjacking.
[1691991483514] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Did I make progress? [39m[choice=yes]

[1691991494945] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Plan: [39m The next part of the plan involves sharing Lucy's fascinating tales from her life in the forest. She wants to narrate the stories about how she saved trapped animals, carved symbols on trees and trained with her axe 'Whisper'. She also wants to offer the opportunity to teach Will about the essential skills in lumberjacking, only if he shows interest.
[1691991502881] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Say: [39mI've been good as well, Will. The forest has been generous with its timber, keeping the village well supplied. Working as a lumberjack has its unique charms. I've rescued animals, carved symbolic markings on the trees, even named my favorite axe! Whisper, I call it. If you're ever curious about the lumberjack's trade, I'd be happy to show you the ropes.

[1691991520822] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Feel: [39mI feel pleased with Will's interest in my job and his enthusiasm about learning the skills of a lumberjack.
[1691991529843] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Explain: [39mI feel I have successfully accomplished my goal to catch up with Will Turner and check on his wellbeing. He seems to be doing well in his work at the mines and even showed a keen interest in my job as a lumberjack. His willingness to learn about the life in the forest and potentially incorporating this new knowledge to his mining job brings me a sense of accomplishment. My narrative about the forest life seemed to have sparked curiosity in him, making our encounter mutually beneficial.
