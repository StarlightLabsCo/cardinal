Plan: 
Based on the priorities of the tasks, the highest priority task is "Chop wood". For fulfilling this task, he needs to move to the location of the nearest tree first, chop the tree using the axe.
After chopping enough wood, Thomas will move towards the second priority task of storing the wood in the chest, for which he will need to move to the chest's location.
Finally, he will fulfil the last priority task of cooking dinner. As we don't have the info necessary for this task right now, we will figure this out once the previous tasks are completed.

Based on the above plan by the reasoning, the best available action would be to move to the nearest tree.

Let's create a JSON object for this action.

Plan: 
1. Thomas should first move to the closest tree to accomplish the "Chop wood" task which is a priority.
2. Once there he can chop wood until the tree's health falls down.
3. After collecting the wood, he needs to store it in the chest. Which means he needs to move to the chest position, and store the wood.
4. Lastly, he can start the "Cook dinner" task.
