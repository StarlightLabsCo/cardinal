[1694638295755] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Plan: [39m Eli plans to make a trip to the deepest part of the forest the next day. Heâ€™s heard tales of an ancient tree, said to be the oldest in the forest, and wishes to see it for himself. Heâ€™s also thinking of mapping the forest trails, making it easier for others to explore. Eli dreams of a day where everyone can interact with nature as he does. He also wants to learn to identify more bird songs, to enhance his understanding of his feathered friends. In the long-term, he hopes to craft a treehouse, a little private sanctuary high in the trees.

He'll put on his favorite exploring gear and pack a small bag with his handmade reed whistle and a small notebook to record his findings. He'll check the sky for the weather, and if the stars align, today's journey could lead him to the tallest tree or the smallest critter. As always, he'll promise to let Thomas know his plans, ensuring his safety while keeping the spirit of exploration alive.
