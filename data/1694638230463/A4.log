[1694638308889] [35m[CORTEX] Lucy Wilde - Plan: [39m Lucy plans to start her day early tomorrow, when the air is still crisp with dew. First thing, she'll inspect the patches where saplings were planted last week. She'll nurture them, leaning on her experience to protect these new lives from harsh winds, pests, and diseases. Later, she'll move to the marked trees, readying her axe 'Whisper' for a day's work. In the evening, she'll share fireside tales with George and impart some forestry wisdom on young Will. Her plans also include feeding an injured squirrel that she saved from a predator. As sunset encroaches, she'll retreat to her cabin, ensuring that she's left the forest better than she found it.
[1694638313851] [35m[CORTEX] Lucy Wilde - Say: [39mEli, remember, the forest offers more than just timber. Listen, and she will share her wisdom. Respect her, and she will provide. Abandon greed, and she will flourish.

I promise to treat her with respect and listen to the wisdom she has to share. No greed, only understanding. And yes, I'll tell Thomas about my expeditions. Safety first, right?
