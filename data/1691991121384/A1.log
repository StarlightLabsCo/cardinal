[1691991195841] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Plan: [39m Thomas Smith is planning to confront Eli Green about his despotic rule over the village. He's gathering evidence of Eli's misdeeds and is also rallying the villagers, encouraging them to stand up against Eli's despotic rule. Thomas Smith is also planning on journeying to Nume Falls to seek the ancient wisdom said to be guarded by the spirits of the waters, hoping they will grant him the strength and guidance to save his village from Eli Green's uncontrollable tyranny.
[1691991200505] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Say: [39mEli Green, your reign of terror ends here. You have drowned our voices for too long. This village belongs to its people, not to your delusional fantasies of grandeur. Your despotic rule is at its end!

[1691991211844] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Feel: [39mI feel confused and suspicious by Eli Green's attempt to downplay his domination over the village.
[1691991221294] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Explain: [39mThomas Smith is taken aback by Eli's seemingly innocent remark. He's taken years gathering evidence and rallying the villagers only now to be received by a clueless response from Eli. He questions if he misunderstood Eli's domineering presence. Is Eli truly just an explorer, a claim Thomas finds hard to believe based on Eli's tyrannical past? However, this confusion does not deter his resolve to establish an open dialogue. He still sees this conversation as a critical step towards liberating the village from Eli's control.

[1691991233508] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Plan: [39m Thomas Smith is planning to show Eli Green the evidence of his despotic rule and how it's been affecting the villagers. He hopes this will help Eli understand the seriousness of the matter and prompt him to change his ways. If Eli continues to deny his actions, Thomas Smith will not hesitate to rally the villagers and depose Eli from his unheld authority over the village. Thomas is also contemplating a visit to Nume Falls, to seek wisdom from the ancient spirits dwelling in its water as originally planned.
[1691991238187] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Say: [39mEli Green, I have evidence of your tyranny and the village has witnessed it too. Your explorations resulted in dominating this village poorly. Let's rectify this situation for the sake of peace.
