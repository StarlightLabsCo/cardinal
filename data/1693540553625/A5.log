[1693540677770] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Explain: [39mThomas asked me to chop trees for the campfire tonight. I'm always up for helping, but I care deeply about the forest and its inhabitants. Each tree is a character in my adventures, and thinking about them being chopped down feels strange

[1693540694375] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green Goodbye: [39mSure thing, Thomas. But can we gather fallen branches instead? I don't like the idea of chopping down trees if we don't need to.
