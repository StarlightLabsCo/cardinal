[1694115061450] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Plan: [39m Eli Green is planning a vigorous day of exploration. He's decided to visit the newly discovered clearance he found the other day. Ever mesmerized by the song of the seasons, he's especially eager to witness the palette that the autumn has painted all over the woods. He wants to use his handmade reed whistle, hoping to gently call out his animal companions. Although itâ€™s just a wishful thought, he dreams of striking a dialogue of sorts with some curious critters. He also plans to spend some peaceful time under the elderly oak where he likes to recount George's extraordinary tales, letting his imagination wander. Eli always ends his day by gazing at the stars till his eyes fall heavy with sleep, ready to rise the next day for another adventure.
[1694115068334] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Say: [39mLucy, I wish you could see the world through my eyes. Every leaf, every rock, every critter... it's all so full of stories and wonder. I can sit for hours just listening to the wild melodies of the forest. I sometimes wonder if the animals understand my whistle, is it possible that they could respond one day?
