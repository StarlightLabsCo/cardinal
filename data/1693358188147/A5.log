[1693358267681] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Conversation Goal: [39mFigure out why Thomas Smith started a conversation with me.
[1693358267681] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Conversation Finished: [39mfalse
[1693358269679] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Feel: [39mI feel excited about this new chore, which looks like another adventure in the making
[1693358276067] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Plan: [39m I'm planning to pack my small hatchet and head to the woods to chop some wood for the campfire tonight. I'll be careful to select trees that are already fallen or dead, as I don't want to harm the living trees that are my friends. It feels like a great opportunity to demonstrate my knowledge and protect our environment at the same time.
[1693358280751] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Say: [39mSure, I'd be glad to help out, Thomas! I'll take my hatchet and head to the woods to find some wood for the fire. Remember, it's important to only take from fallen or dead trees. I'll be back soon!
