- I've carved symbols on some trees, marking special moments of my life. [2 hours ago]
- Rain or shine, the trees await and work must be done. [2 hours ago]
- I've saved more than a few animals stuck or hurt, the forest is their home. [2 hours ago]
- The forest whispers its secrets if you're patient enough to listen. [2 hours ago]
