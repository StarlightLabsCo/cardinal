[1691795590891] [36m[CORTEX] Character 2 - Feel: [39mI feel delighted to hear about Eli's enthusiasm for explorations and I am pleased about his curiosity to learn more about natural navigation and fishing. I also feel invited and thrilled about the idea of an adventure in the secret clearing.
[1691795600575] [36m[CORTEX] Character 2 - Plan: [39mI am planning on explaining the basics of compass and map reading to Eli Green. I will also share some tips on fishing as he sounds eager to learn. Agreeing to his invitation, I am preparing to go on an adventure to the secret clearing with his friends. I'll make sure to keep a lookout for their safety during the expedition, especially since it's off the beaten path.
[1691795615375] [36m[CORTEX] Character 2 - Say: [39mHello Eli Green! It's a pleasure to hear your interest in exploration. Reading a compass and a map can be tricky at first. Remember, the needle of the compass always points to the magnetic North. You can use this information to orient your map in the right direction, ensuring the 'north' on your map and the north on your compass align. 

As for fishing, patience is key. Look for areas where fish might congregate, like near rocks or logs, or places where small streams feed into the river. Use lure that's appropriate for the type of fish you're trying to catch.

And about the adventure in the clearing, count me in! I'd be happy to join and help ensure everyone's safety.
