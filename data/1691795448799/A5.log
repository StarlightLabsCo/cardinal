[1691795581062] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Plan: [39m Eli is planning to explore the forest, look for new animals and rare plants, and search for hidden treasure in the caves. He plans to ask Thomas Smith how to read a compass and map, and he wants to learn how to fish. He also wants to organise an adventure with all his friends in the secret clearing that he found.
[1691795586745] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Say: [39mHi Mr. Smith! I'm Eli Green, an explorer! Can you share any tips on reading a compass and map? I'm also curious about fishing. By the way, I'm organizing an adventure for my friends in the secret clearing I found. Would you like to join us?

[1691795619902] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Feel: [39mI feel excited and reassured that Mr. Smith is so approachable and helpful, and thrilled that he will be joining us for the adventure in the clearing.
[1691795634660] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Explain: [39mI have made significant progress towards my goal. Understanding how to read a compass and a map surely helps me become a better explorer. It's interesting to learn how the compass needle always points to the magnetic North and how I have to align it with the 'north' on the map. It's going to make my future expeditions much easier! As for fishing, I now know what to look for when trying to catch fish â€“ areas where fish might congregate, like near rocks or logs, or places where small streams feed into the river. It's all very fascinating! But the highlight of it all is certainly Mr. Smith agreeing to join us for the adventure in the clearing. He would be the perfect guide, and I feel that with his presence, our adventure will be much safer and more enjoyable. All these experiences are valuable lessons for a young explorer like me!
[1691795635707] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Did I make progress? [39m[choice=yes]
[1691795636921] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Did I accomplish my goal? [39m[choice=yes]
[1691795641576] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 Goodbye: [39mThanks for all your help, Mr. Smith! I learned a lot from you. I'll start practicing with my map and compass, and who knows, maybe I'll catch my first fish soon. Looking forward to our adventure in the clearing. See you then!
