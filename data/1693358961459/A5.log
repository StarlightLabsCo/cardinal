He intends to use his reed whistle to try and communicate with the animals. He also plans to deliver the chopped wood to Thomas Smith and further engage in conversation to gain more knowledge and experiences.
[1693359316273] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Say: [39mTomorrow, I'm headed back into the forest. I'm excited to learn more about our animal friends, and to try out my reed whistle. Oh, and I'll drop off that chopped wood to Thomas! Always another adventure waiting out there.

[1693359325621] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Prior Message: [39mLooking forward to the wood, Eli. Stay safe out there in the wilderness.
