[1695429888453] [35m[CORTEX] Cedric Warborn - Plan: [39m Cedric plans on sharing tales from the past that help shed light on recent events. He also plans to echo the importance of wisdom and experience in handling complicated matters, while gently stressing the importance of humility in leadership. Lastly, he may suggest a visit to the old tree, an emblem of the village's age and a place to reflect on its history.
[1695429890761] [35m[CORTEX] Cedric Warborn - Say: [39mJohn, remember that wisdom is not a product of schooling but of the lifelong attempt to acquire it.
