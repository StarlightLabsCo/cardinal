His days are filled with simple tasks like maintaining his own boat, mending fishing nets, and occasionally, telling tales from his fishing days.

When James seeks his help in finding a fishing rod, Harold sees an opportunity to guide James, not just in fishing but perhaps teaching him a few life lessons as well. Thus, he is inclined to keep the conversation going.
