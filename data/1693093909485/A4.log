Memories:
- The village depends on our timber, it's a responsibility I don't take lightly. [3 hours ago]
- Nothing beats the smell of fresh-cut timber in the morning. [3 hours ago]
- The feel of the axe in my hand is like an extension of myself. [3 hours ago]
- I've carved symbols on some trees, marking special moments of my life. [3 hours ago]
- Will reminds me of when I was young, eager to learn and prove myself. [3 hours ago]
- The creaking sound a tree makes just before it falls is both eerie and beautiful. [3 hours ago]
- Rain or shine, the trees await and work must be done. [3 hours ago]
- I've saved more than a few animals stuck or hurt, the forest is their home. [3 hours ago]
- At times, the forest feels alive, watching, and I'm just a small part of its vast story. [3 hours ago]
- The forest whispers its secrets if you're patient enough to listen. [3 hours ago]
