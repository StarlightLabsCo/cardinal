[1694673457573] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Feel: [39mI feel like I'm gradually becoming a part of this mining community, learning more every day and becoming more adept at navigating around. I feel a sense of purpose and belonging.
[1694673462697] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Plan: [39m Will plans to explain to Thomas how to get to Nume Village. He remembers that the village is near their mine site which is located to the north east of the village, through the forest at 51, 17.
[1694673467282] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Say: [39mNume Village? Sure thing, Thomas. It's through the forest, just south west of our mine site, around coordinates 51, 17. It's a charming place. You can't miss it.

[1694673485753] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Prior Message: [39mWould you be willing to take me there? I get lost easily

[1694673490893] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Feel: [39mI feel a sense of responsibility to help Thomas. He needs someone to guide him and I'm more than willing to do so.
[1694673503495] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Explain: [39mThomas has asked Will to guide him to Nume Village given Thomas's propensity to get lost easily. Clearly, Thomas initiated the conversation as he needed assistance in navigation. This sudden responsibility pushes Will a step closer to his goal of becoming an integral part of the mining community, bridging the distance between being a raw apprentice and a trusted fine-tuned member of the unit. Directly guiding Thomas to the village will give Will a chance to put his understanding of the location and routes to test, something he practiced over time with diligence. Moreover, it provides him an opportunity to engage in close communication with a veteran miner, thus acting as a subtle opportunity to learn and absorb wisdom.

He feels that guiding Thomas to Nume Village would be a good step in understanding the routes better. He decides to take up Thomas's offer and guide him to Nume Village.
[1694673513825] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Should I end the conversation? [39m[yes]
