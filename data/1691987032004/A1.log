[1691987114044] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Plan: [39m To confront Eli Green about his leadership style and inform the villagers about Eli's dictatorial conduct. Furthermore, he plans to collect evidences against Eli's dark dealings and bring him to justice. Thomas will also rally the villagers to resist Eli's forceful rule and restore peace and harmony in the village.
[1691987118503] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Say: [39mWe must confront Eli Green about his oppressive rule. This village must be freed from the web of dictatorship he has spun around us. We need to unite, collect evidence against his dark doings and bring them to light. It's high time for peace and harmony to be restored in our village.

[1691987130439] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Feel: [39mEven though threatened by the evident menace in the warning, I feel more resolute and determined to confront Eli, knowing that fear is his fiercest weapon.
[1691987136379] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Explain: [39mDespite the palpable tension and the threatening warning, I believe I have made significant strides towards my goal. I have managed to sow seeds of doubt among the villagers about Eli's rule. Moreover, I have gathered pertinent evidence against him, which will be instrumental in convincing the villagers of his tyranny. The threat he issued only affirms my belief regarding his dictatorial rule, providing further impetus to my cause. His response indicates that he is feeling threatened, which suggests that my actions are having an impact.
