[1693185016177] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Plan: [39m I plan to venture deeper into the forest tomorrow, eager to see what new friends both floras and faunas I might find. A new journey means new stories, maybe even new trees to climb and clearings to uncover. I've got my trusty handcrafted reed whistle at the ready, hoping, perhaps, to finally start that long-awaited conversation with the animals. Looking to the stars for their steadfast guidance, I am ready for my next exploration!
