[1691127251284]Plan: 
[1691127251284]1. Given the location of the character at 5.7,-57.9 and the priority of tasks, the first step would be to move to the mine site at location 51,17. 

2. After reaching the mine site, the character will mine ore using the pickaxe from the inventory. 

3. Once mining is done, extra materials would be stored in the chest. 

4. Then, moving back to the village at location 2,-58 would be the next step. 

5. After returning to the village, the character will chop trees using the axe from the inventory. 

6. Once that's completed, the character will do a round for the village safety check. 

7. Lastly, the character will go to bed at 10pm according to the character's memory.

So, Thomas Smith will start by moving to the mine site which is the highest priority task in his list. He will use the "functions.MoveTo" to achieve this. 

Tasks involving dropping the tools from his inventory like Axe, Pickaxe, and Sword are nowhere mentioned in the tasks list and hence will not be carried out. 

Action:

[1691127280413]Plan: 
[1691127280413]Given that the highest priority task is to move to the mine site at location 51, 17, that will be the first action to perform. After reaching the mine site, the character can then perform the task to mine ore. The Character can move back to the village after finishing mining to store extra materials. After that, he will concentrate on chopping trees and will check the safety of the village. He will conclude his day by going to bed at 10PM according to his memory log.

Here are the step by step actions based on priority:

1. Move to the mine site from location (5.7, -57.9) to (51, 17).
2. Start mining ore.
3. Store extra materials in the chest.
4. Move back to the village from location (51, 17) to (2, -58).
5. Begin chopping trees.
6. Check on village safety.
7. Lastly, go to bed at 10pm.

Considering these steps my first action will be to use the MoveTo function to go to the mine site at location (51, 17). After performing this action, the inventory and environment might change based on the results. 

Action to perform:

functions.MoveTo({ characterId: "A1", x: 51, y: 17 })

[1691127310592]Plan: 
[1691127310592]1. Implement the "moveTo" function to go to the location of the mine (51, 17), following task 1.
2. Once arrived at the mine, wait for further instructions. During this time, the "mine ore" task will be accomplished.
3. Apply the "moveTo" function again to return to the village (2, -58), following task 4.
4. Upon arriving at the village, perform the task of chopping trees given in task 5.
5. Check on the safety of the village as per task 6. This may involve interacting with fellow villagers and inspecting the overall village.
6. Around 10 pm, according to task 7, the "go to bed" action should be applied.
   
Selected action: 
Use the MoveTo function to move to the mine at location 51,17. Here is how we should proceed:

```javascript
functions.MoveTo({characterId: "A1", x:51, y:17});
```  

This action is selected since it's the first task with highest priority. As it's currently 12am, there is enough time to move, mine, and perform subsequent tasks. It's important to start moving now, because according to the inventory, Thomas possesses the necessary tool (pickaxe) for mining.
