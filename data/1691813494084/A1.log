[1691813869210] [36m[CORTEX] Character 2 - Say: [39mGood day, Eli! These woods have been home for a long time indeed. There's beauty and resourcefulness all around us. Towards the northeast, at around X: 54.5, Y: 13.66, you'll find a magnificent overlook that grants a panorama of the entire village. For flora and fauna, do head towards the forested mountains. Be respectful - it's home to a large variety of wildlife whether it be under the lush canopies or by the river's edge. 

If you're interested in collecting resources, there is a Coal Ore Deposit at X: 57.27, Y: 17.32. But remember, it's important we maintain balance and only take what we need. We have safety regulations in place, and I hope you'll follow them. The woods are a part of us and we have to look out for them just as they have for us.
