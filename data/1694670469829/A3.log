[1694670525901] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Feel: [39mI feel surprised but excited that Thomas is asking me about Nume Village.
[1694670527850] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Plan: [39m Guide Thomas to Nume Village and share information about the village.
[1694670531070] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Say: [39mHi Thomas! I sure am, Nume Village is my home. It's just east of here. Follow me, I'll guide you there.

[1694670542626] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Prior Message: [39mThat'd be great!
[1694670542626] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Patience: [39m100
[1694670542626] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Conversation Goal: [39mFigure out why Thomas Smith started a conversation with me.
[1694670542626] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Conversation Finished: [39mfalse
[1694670544393] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Feel: [39mI feel enthusiastic to help Thomas find his way to Nume Village.
[1694670558284] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Explain: [39mThomas Smith started a conversation with me today. At first, I was unsure why. It was unexpected, and I couldn't figure out a likely reason. However, Thomas soon revealed that he was searching for Nume Village. This made things clearer. His conversation wasn't random, but rather a request for help. I was, in fact, familiar with the village he was searching for, and so I offered to guide him there. This interaction suggests that my reputation as a knowledgeable and helpful person is growing within the mining community, which feels like a progression towards my dream of becoming a respected miner like my father. Therefore, I can confidently say that I have made progress towards understanding why Thomas initiated the conversation with me.
[1694670559369] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Did I make progress? [39m[yes]
[1694670560522] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Did I accomplish my goal? [39m[yes]
[1694670568425] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Explain: [39mExcited to be of help, I feel this is an opportune moment to not just show, but introduce Thomas to the heart of Nume Village, let him soak in its charm and meet its amazing people. However, we do need to be mindful of the setting sun, meaning the conversation may need to be cut short but the intention is to start afresh after a good night's rest.
[1694670569754] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Should I end the conversation? [39m[yes]
[1694670573490] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner Goodbye: [39mGreat Thomas! Let's make a move then. We should reach before it gets too dark. We can continue our talk tomorrow. Goodnight.
