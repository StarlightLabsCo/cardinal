[1691988246812] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Plan: [39m After catching up with Thomas Smith, Eli plans to go for a brief exploration around the forest, as he is entrusted with the task of finding wild berries for dinner. He also wants to check out if there's anything new or strange happening around. Given his innate curiosity, Eli always searches for a mystery or challenge in his little adventures. Consequently, meeting new animals, finding peculiar artifacts, or discovering unusual markings on trees forms part of his exploration plan. Later, he hopes to share his experiences and findings with his best friend Lucy. Lastly, never forgetting his bond with nature, Eli aims to conclude his day by stargazing and contemplating the vastness of the universe.

[1691988269825] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Explain: [39mI surely made progress towards my goal. I managed to catch up with Thomas Smith, as planned. I learned about the updates in the village, particularly about the new bakery and the twin lambs Mrs. Johnson had. This information can be useful during my explorations. Knowing about the bakery gives me a potential place to explore and the fact about the lambs helps me understand the animal behavior in the village. Next, I'll embark on my exploration to the forest for finding wild berries and anything new or unusual.
