- The feel of the axe in my hand is like an extension of myself. [13 hours ago]
- Every lumberjack has a favorite axe; mine's named 'Whisper'. [13 hours ago]
- George and I have shared tales over campfires many nights. [13 hours ago]
- The village depends on our timber, it's a responsibility I don't take lightly. [13 hours ago]
- I've saved more than a few animals stuck or hurt, the forest is their home. [13 hours ago]
- I remember the tallest tree I've ever felled, stood mighty for over a century. [13 hours ago]
- The creaking sound a tree makes just before it falls is both eerie and beautiful. [13 hours ago]
- The forest whispers its secrets if you're patient enough to listen. [13 hours ago]
- At times, the forest feels alive, watching, and I'm just a small part of its vast story. [13 hours ago]
