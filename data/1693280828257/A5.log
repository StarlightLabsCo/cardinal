[1693280921957] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Feel: [39mI feel excited about the prospect of helping out, but also worried about chopping down a tree which would mean ending a story from our forest
[1693280927567] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Plan: [39m I am planning to find a fallen or dead tree in the forest, as it would be more sustainable and respectful to nature, instead of chopping down a living tree just for the firewood. Iâ€™ll then chop the wood and bring it back to Thomas
[1693280931740] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Say: [39mAlright, Thomas! I'll find us some firewood. But remember, trees are friends too. I'll search for a fallen one instead. Wait for me!

[1693280957231] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Explain: [39mI believe I've made progress towards my goal of figuring out why Thomas Smith started a conversation with me. He needs firewood for the cooking fire tonight and he trusts me to take care of it with respect towards our forest friends. I understand the task and why he's asked me to do it. I feel reassured and helpful.

[1693280966475] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Plan: [39m I am planning to head towards the forest, where I often seek out my adventures. I will be on the lookout for a fallen or dead tree which I can chop down for firewood, making sure to respect the living trees. My goal is to have enough firewood before sunset and get it back in time for dinner preparations.
