[1693196135301] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Explain: [39mEli now understands why Thomas initiated the conversation. It wasn't a casual chat or a storytelling session as it often is with George. The urgency of the situation - a campfire needed for the night with the available wood being all wet - justified Thomas reaching out to him. Knowing this, Eli feels he's made progress towards his goal.

[1693196148095] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Say: [39mOkay, Thomas. I understand. Let me find a tree that's old or sick so we're not hurting the forest too much. But, let's also talk about how we source our firewood in the future. I think we can do better.
