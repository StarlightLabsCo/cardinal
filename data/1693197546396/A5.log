[1693197640933] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Plan: [39m I plan to go to the cave on the western edge of the woods where the stone ores are abundant. I'll bring my sturdy pick with me and mine some for Thomas. I might also explore new corners of the cavern while Iâ€™m there, turning this task into an exciting adventure.

[1693197679928] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Explain: [39mThrough Thomas' request for stone ores, I've learned that his reason for initiating a conversation with me was due to the breakdown of his pickaxe and his subsequent need for stone ores.
