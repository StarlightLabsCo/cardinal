[1694676118389] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Explain: [39mThomas has asked Will to guide him to Nume Village. This puts Will in a new role—instead of the apprentice, he's the guide. This request from Thomas evokes pride and a sense of responsibility in Will. As a native of the village, he knows the route like the back of his hand, and this gives him the perfect opportunity to use that knowledge. Even though he's been in the mines all day, Thomas's request fills him with energy. Most importantly, it indirectly validates Will's mining efforts and hints that Thomas now sees him, not just as the 'new kid', but as a member of the mining community. In essence, it bolsters his confidence and reaffirms his dedication to the mining profession. He is now eager to guide Thomas to the village, adding another new experience on his quest of adventure.

He intends to lead Thomas to the village, ensuring his safe arrival. The conversation with Thomas shall continue till they reach their destination as it is a matter of pride and responsibility for Will. He'd also enjoy the company and the exchange of stories that the journey promises.
[1694676133316] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Should I end the conversation? [39m[no]
[1694676151225] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Plan: [39m Firstly, Will plans to sketch a mental map based on his personal knowledge of the terrain and recall any landmarks that might aid on their journey. This will also help him reassure Thomas of the feasibility of their upcoming travel. Then, he will inform Thomas about the plan and communicate any necessary details for the journey such as the terrain, estimated time, and any possible risks they might encounter. After all the information is clearly communicated and understood by both, they will commence their journey to Nume Village.
[1694676154222] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Say: [39mAbsolutely, Thomas! I'll make sure you reach Nume Village safely. Please, follow me.
