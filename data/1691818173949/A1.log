As long as everyone in the village continues to prioritize safety and community, we will continue to thrive. However, we mustn't become complacent. We should keep an eye on the resources available in our village, like the coal ore deposit, and consider how we might use or preserve them in the future. Continual vigilance and open conversation will help us maintain this progress.
