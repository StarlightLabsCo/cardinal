[1694671114381] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Feel: [39mI feel hopeful. This could be an opportunity to guide Thomas Smith towards Nume Village.
[1694671117675] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Plan: [39m Will is planning on guiding Thomas Smith to Nume Village. He's excited about the prospect of showing someone his home and sharing its stories.
[1694671120934] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Say: [39mHi Thomas, yes I am. I can guide you to Nume Village. It's not far from here.

[1694671141213] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Prior Message: [39mThat'd be great! I get lost easily so if you'd be willing to take me there I'd really appreciate it.

[1694671142986] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Feel: [39mI feel helpful
[1694671154231] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Explain: [39mIn response to Thomas' request for help, Will feels eager to assist. This aligns with his congenial and helpful nature. He sees this as an opportunity to prove himself, not only as a miner but also as a responsible member of his community. Assisting Thomas would allow him to exhibit his knowledge about the terrain and routes, bringing him closer to establishing himself as a competent miner. Moreover, in the process, he may be able to extract more stories and experiences from Thomas which can be added to his repertoire of mining tales. All these factors contribute to making progress towards his goal of understanding why Thomas started the conversation with him.
[1694671155833] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Did I make progress? [39m[yes]
[1694671157098] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Did I accomplish my goal? [39m[yes]
[1694671167478] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Explain: [39mWill is ever the helpful sort and never one to let someone remain lost. His decision to help guide Thomas Smith to Nume Village comes naturally. He feels the tug of adventure pulling at him, the prospect of leading another to their destination, and the opportunity to share his knowledge of the local area. He also wants to continue his conversation with Thomas, learning more about the older miner's stories that enrich his own experience. Maybe leading the way to Nume Village would even grant him a new tale to share with the village folk.
[1694671168781] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Should I end the conversation? [39m[yes]
[1694671173013] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner Goodbye: [39mSure Thomas! I'd be more than happy to guide you to Nume Village. Let's just finish up for the day and we can head there together. Goodbye for now!
