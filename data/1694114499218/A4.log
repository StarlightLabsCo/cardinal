[1694114555691] [35m[CORTEX] Lucy Wilde - Plan: [39m Lucy is planning to venture deeper into the forest to mark some new trees for lumber as the village's demand for timber increases. Along her journey, she also intends to check on the saplings she planted on her last visit to ensure they're growing well. Knowing that young Will is eager to learn, she decides to invite him along to share her knowledge and passion for the forest. She also plans to sit down for a heart-to-heart conversation with George by the campfire, to ponder over forest tales and potentially save any distressed animals they may encounter on their journey.
