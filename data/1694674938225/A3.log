[1694675142559] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Plan: [39m Will Turner is planning to accompany Thomas, showing him the way to Nume Village. Along the way, he hopes to share stories of previous mining adventures and discuss plans for unexplored paths in the mine that could potentially lead to a vein of rare gems. The route to the village is a familiar one for Will, trodden time and again since childhood. He knows the forest along the path, its silent stoic trees standing like ancient guardians. Will aspires to imbue the journey with the thrill of their shared profession, hoping to inspire Thomas with the magic and allure of their craft as they traverse the woods back to the village.
