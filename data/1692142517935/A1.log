[1692142579843] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Plan: [39m Thomas Smith is planning to confront Eli Green about his alarming behavior and authoritarian rule over the village. To challenge Eli's oppressive reign, Thomas intends to rally the villagers and spark a movement of resistance. At the same time, he expresses concern for Eli's health due to his overpowering presence and harsh demeanor, and plans to suggest he seek help. Lastly, Thomas plans to continue overseeing the safety of the village and maintaining its borders from the forested mountains and the wild beasts that lurk within. He also wants to secure the campsite and inspect the whereabouts of Eli Green, which was last known at coordinates X: 39.95, Y: -4.89.
[1692142583534] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Say: [39mEli, I think it's time we had a talk. People are worried and the village needs someone who can lead with kindness, not fear. And you, you don't look well, maybe you should seek some help.

[1692142596382] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Feel: [39mI feel relieved that Eli Green received the conversation well and agreed to make changes for the betterment of the village.
[1692142606339] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Explain: [39mThomas Smith feels that he has made a significant progress towards his goal of challenging Eli Green's oppressive reign after their conversation. With Eli Green understanding his concerns and agreeing to seek help, Thomas perceives this as the initial step towards a more democratic, empathetic, and fair governance of the village. He is relieved to know that Eli Green has shown a willingness to potentially change and have a positive impact on the village. Thomas Smith believes this progress could hopefully pave the way for further improvement in the village governance and contribute to the long term safety and wellbeing of its inhabitants.
