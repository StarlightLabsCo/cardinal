[1691731923405] [36m[CORTEX] Character 2 - Feel: [39mI feel excited to share what I know about the areas Thomas has asked about and eager to help him find the best spots!
[1691731932636] [36m[CORTEX] Character 2 - Plan: [39mI plan on sharing with Thomas everything I know about the coal ore deposit at X: 56.74, Y: 14.81, as well as any information I have on the campsite at 7, -8.3. I'll also consider the best places I know to find strawberries and mention those locations to him.
[1691731950598] [36m[CORTEX] Character 2 - Say: [39mHello Thomas! I'm doing really well, thank you. About the coal ore deposit at X: 56.74, Y: 14.81, I can say that the area is mostly quiet. I haven't noticed anything unusual there. But be careful, it's a bit rocky.

As for the campsite at 7, -8.3, I think I know the one you're talking about. It has a small pond nearby and thereâ€™s this flat surface that's perfect for setting up a camp. I must say, it's quite a serene place, especially at sunrise.

And about strawberries, I know a great spot! You can find lots of them in a sunny open field near the creek at X: 65.32, Y: 20.27. The smell of ripe strawberries there is intoxicating! But remember, Thomas, always leave some for nature's little critters.
