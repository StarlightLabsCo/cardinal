[1691731910100] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Plan: [39m To explore the coal ore deposit at X: 56.74, Y: 14.81, and manage its extraction to benefit the village. Simultaneously, he plans to ensure the safety and welfare of all villagers, including Eli Green. Furthermore, Smith plans to develop strategies to keep the village shielded from any wildlife threats from the surrounding mountains. Another part of his plan includes investigating the campsite at 7, -8.3 for any signs of danger or resource opportunity. Thomas is also interested in the cultivation of strawberries for personal interest as well as potential nutritional value for the village.
[1691731919334] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Say: [39mHello Eli, I hope you're doing well. I was planning to visit the coal ore deposit at X: 56.74, Y: 14.81 and consider its extraction for the benefit of us all. Have you noticed anything unusual around that area, perhaps, while hunting? Also, I'm thinking of checking the campsite at 7, -8.3. Do you have any information about it? And about the strawberries, do you know a great spot where we can find them?

[1691731956977] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Feel: [39mI feel relieved to learn that the coal ore deposit area is safe with no unusual activity reported, grateful for the precise details about the campsite, and excited about the prospect of finding a field full of strawberries.
[1691731966860] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Explain: [39mIt seems that I've made significant progress towards my goals. With Eli confirming that the area around the coal ore deposit is safe, I can start coordinating villagers to begin mining operations which will definitely contribute to the village's resources. The description of the campsite with a small pond and flat surface will be useful to guide villagers if they choose to camp there or it could serve as a backup evacuation spot in case of emergencies. The strawberry field is a bonus. Not only would it fulfill a personal joy, but those berries could introduce a new food source for the villagers. Overall, I am pleased with the information obtained and feel confident about next steps.
[1691731968585] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Did I make progress? [39m[choice=yes]

[1691731977715] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 Goodbye: [39mThank you for the information, Eli. Your guidance has been invaluable. I'll make sure to be careful around the rocky terrain near the coal ore deposit, and also during my visit to the campsite. Also, I am excited to visit the strawberry fields you mentioned. I assure that we will leave some for nature. Goodbye for now, Eli and take care. Hope to see you around the village soon.
[1691731992164] [31m[createMemory][39m Eli assured me that the coal ore deposit at X: 56.74, Y: 14.81 is safe and mostly quiet, though a bit rocky. [21.3769951]
[1691731992164] [31m[createMemory][39m He gave me a detailed description of the campsite at 7, -8.3, mentioning a small pond by it, and how it's particularly serene at sunrise. [21.3769951]
[1691731992164] [31m[createMemory][39m Eli mentioned that there are plentiful strawberries in a sunny open field near the creek at X: 65.32, Y: 20.27, inviting with the smell of ripe fruit. [21.3769951]
[1691731992164] [31m[createMemory][39m He reminded me about the importance of coexisting with nature and to leave some strawberries for the little critters. [21.3769951]
