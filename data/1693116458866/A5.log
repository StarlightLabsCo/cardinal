[1693116517803] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Feel: [39mI feel conflicted, knowing I need to help Lucy but aware of the harm it could cause to my dear friend, the tree
[1693116521570] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Plan: [39m I am planning to quickly search for a tree that has already fallen or one that's dead, so it wouldn't cause unnecessary harm. I then intend to chop it and gather enough wood to make a sturdy splint for Lucy. Once that is done, I'll rush back to her.
