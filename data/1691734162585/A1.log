[1691734338483] [36m[CORTEX] Character 2 - Say: [39mEli, that sounds like a grand adventure! Those coordinates are near the Coal Ore Deposit I spotted recently, there might be more valuable resources there. However, the woods can be unpredictable. How about you take a few more villagers with you, just to be on the safe side?
