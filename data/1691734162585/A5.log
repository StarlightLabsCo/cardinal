[1691734326567] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Say: [39mHi Thomas! I'm planning to head out for an exploration trip today. I even found a Coal Ore Deposit at coordinates X: 59.9, Y: 16.03. I'm hoping to uncover more exciting things in the woods! I'll be careful.

[1691734341287] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Feel: [39mappreciative of Thomas's concern for his safety and excited about the possibility of finding more valuable resources.
[1691734353861] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Explain: [39mI'm glad that Thomas gave me permission to go on my exploration. Not only that, he also mentioned the possibility of finding more valuable resources at the coordinates, which makes me more eager to go. His suggestion about taking more villagers with me is prudent. Though I'm an explorer, I must admit that the woods can be unpredictable, and it's safer to have more people just in case. This conversation went well and I believe I'm making progress towards my goal of exploring.
