[1693186061510] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Plan: [39m I am planning to pick the least healthy tree, one that might not survive the next season. This way, it can serve a purpose for us while minimizing the impact on the forest. I will then use my axe to chop it down safely and prepare it for tonight's campfire.
[1693186064248] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Say: [39mAlright, I'll find a tree for tonight's campfire. But I'll make sure it's one that won't harm the forest too much if it's gone. We need to respect nature, too.
