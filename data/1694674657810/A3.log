[1694674764700] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Plan: [39m Will Turner plans to continue his conversation with Thomas Smith. He thinks of explaining to him about the location of Nume Village, although he himself is still relatively new to the area. However, he'll try conferring with other miners or using familiar landmarks in and around the mines to give directions.
[1694674769746] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Say: [39mHi Thomas. I think you might've taken a wrong turn. Nume Village isn't far from here. Continue down this path, take the second left towards the old oak tree, then just follow the river upstream. You should see the village then.

[1694674796702] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Feel: [39mSure thing, Thomas! It'll be nice to get some fresh air. Just give me a moment to gather my tools.
[1694674807752] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Explain: [39mThomas Smith asked me to guide him to Nume Village. Considering that I'm relatively new to this environment, this request puts me in a new situation. While I've started understanding the layout of the mines, the surroundings of the village are a bit unfamiliar. However, taking up this task would also mean an opportunity to know the place better. Also, it feels nice to be of help. Therefore, despite the uncertainty, I see this as a prospect for learning and more importantly, building camaraderie with my fellow miners.
[1694674809079] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Did I make progress? [39m[yes]
[1694674812036] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Did I accomplish my goal? [39m[yes]
[1694674823066] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Explain: [39mThomas Smith's request to be guided to Nume Village certainly gives a new goal to our conversation. I believe this could be a good opportunity for me to learn more about the surrounding areas of the mines, all while helping a fellow miner. Therefore, I don't think we should end the conversation just yet. I'd like to discuss the journey to the village with Smith, ascertain that he's prepared for any possible hardships, and ensure that we have everything we need. Also, it seems like this could lead to a more meaningful connection with Smith, which is quite valuable in a challenging environment like the mines.
