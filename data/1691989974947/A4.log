[1691990076562] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Plan: [39m Begin her usual routine - waking up at the crack of dawn, gearing up with her trusty axe, heading into the expanse of the forest to handpick the trees she needs to fell for the day. After the work in the woods, she would jot down in her journal about the day in the forest, any peculiar happenings noticed. She's also planning to carve a new symbol on a tree, marking yet another special moment of her life. She'd then head back to the village, delivering the timber, making the rounds, having a good meal hopefully, and tending to her axe before sleeping to get ready for another day.
[1691990080474] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Say: [39mAnother day in the whispering woods awaits me. The village needs its timber, and Iâ€™m the one to deliver. Rain or shine, thereâ€™s work to be done.

[1691990093742] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Feel: [39mI feel determined and prepared for the day ahead, acknowledging the responsibility I carry for the village and embracing the work in the forest with respect.
[1691990102258] [35m[CORTEX] Character 1 - Explain: [39mToday felt productive. I've chosen and chopped down the strongest trees for timber. My skills as a woodswoman are just as sharp as my axe. I believe I made significant progress towards my daily goal, ensuring a steady supply of wood for the village. I'm also content because I've managed to spend some time in quiet appreciation of the forest, listening to its whispers. Despite the hard work, I feel at home in the woods.
