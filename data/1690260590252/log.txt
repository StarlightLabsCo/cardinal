[1690260636865]Plan: 
[1690260636865]Given the highest priority task is to "Chop wood", Thomas Smith should move towards the nearest tree to chop it down. The trees' coordinates are provided, and the nearest one appears to be the one at [X: 0.86, Y: -0.9]. Therefore, Thomas should move immediately to that location to complete the task.

After chopping the wood, he should store the wood in the chest which is located at [X: -5.51, Y: -4.46], as per his task list and then cook the dinner. Let's start Thomas on his day by moving towards the nearest tree first.

[1690260650411]Plan: 
[1690260650412]Given that Thomas' highest priority task is to chop wood and the closest tree is within his hitbox, he should swing his axe to chop it. After chopping the tree, he should prioritize moving wood to the chest. Finally, provided there will be enough daylight left, he could cook dinner as per his third priority task. 

Based on the provided information, Thomas can try to accomplish these tasks in the following way: 

1. Use the axe to chop the nearest tree.
2. Collect the chopped wood.
3. Move towards the location of the chest (keeping in mind the X, Y coordinates).
4. Store the chopped wood in the chest.
5. Begin preparing dinner if there's enough time left in the day.

Given the available information, update your task list, and pick the best available action to accomplish the highest priority task. Respond in JSON: { type: [ActionType], data: {characterId optional parameters}}. Please note that if an action is in the available items list, you can execute it immediately, without needing to change or move. First you should list your reasoning and create a plan, and then using that plan, select an action and create a JSON object for that action with the necessary info. The JSON object must be immediately after "Action: " as we're using regex to parse it.

[1690260662389]Plan: 
[1690260662389]1. Thomas Smith needs to chop wood according to the highest priority task, which means he would need to find a tree.
2. From his memories, Thomas remembers several close trees. However, according to the hitbox information, he is already adjacent to a tree with a health of 5/10.
3. Therefore, the logical course of action for Thomas would be to swing his axe at the tree. This would directly contribute to the highest-priority task of chopping wood without needing to move anywhere or alter the task list.

[1690260677443]Plan: 
[1690260677443]As a first priority, Thomas should complete his task of chopping wood. Since he currently has an axe and is standing by a tree stump, he doesn't need to move in order to start this task. After chopping the wood, Thomas can drop the wood onto the ground. Finally, he can move to the nearest tree to continue his task of chopping wood.

Reasoning:
- Thomas's first priority task is to chop wood.
- He has an axe in his inventory and is already at a tree stump.
- Therefore, Thomas doesn't need to move right now to start his task.
- After chopping the wood from the tree stump, Thomas can drop the wood on the ground, which won't require any movement.
- Then, he can move to the nearest tree to continue his task of chopping wood.

[1690260704140]Plan: 
[1690260704140]According to Thomas's priority task list, his immediate task is to pick up wood (priority 1). In his inventory, wood is already there; hence, no need to navigate to any tree. The next task is to move to the closest tree (priority 2). Considering all listed trees, Thomas is closest to the tree located at X: -0.6865366, Y: -1.433641, at a distance of 1.639219m. Thus, the next action is to send Thomas to that location.

Reasoning:
Thomas's immediate task of picking up wood isn't necessary as he holds some in his inventory. So we must proceed to the next priority task, i.e., move to the closest tree. Now, analyzing the surrounding, the nearest tree is located at X: -0.6865366, Y: -1.433641, with a distance of 1.639219m. Following the task priority, a move towards this tree is the next action. 

Action:
{ "type": "MoveTo", "data": { "characterId": "A1", "x": -0.6865366, "y": -1.433641 }}
