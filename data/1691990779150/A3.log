[1691991035585] [31m[createMemory][39m Lucy Wilde started a conversation with me. [189.625076]
[1691991036115] [31mAgent A3 is already occupied. Skipping...[39m
[1691991047403] [36m[CORTEX] Character 2 - Feel: [39mI feel intrigued yet slightly taken aback by the question, my determination towards mining is challenged for the first time
[1691991051966] [36m[CORTEX] Character 2 - Plan: [39mI plan to keep working in the mines. It's not just a job, it's a legacy. My father was a miner, and his father before him. May consider Lucy's suggestion, but for now, mining is my path.
[1691991057051] [36m[CORTEX] Character 2 - Say: [39mGood morning, Lucy! The mines are challenging but rewarding. Something less...underground? I haven't really considered it. Mining is in my blood. It's a family tradition.

[1691991085142] [36m[CORTEX] Character 2 - Feel: [39mI feel intrigued and a little excited at the prospect of seeing the forest through a lumberjack's eyes, despite my commitment to mining
[1691991090963] [36m[CORTEX] Character 2 - Plan: [39mI plan on accepting Lucy's invitation for a walk in the forest. It might be interesting to see nature from a different perspective and understand the fulfillment she finds in her work as a lumberjack. However, my commitment remains to mining.
[1691991096363] [36m[CORTEX] Character 2 - Say: [39mThat does sound fascinating, Lucy. I've rarely had the chance to truly observe the forest. I'd love to join you on a walk and see it from your perspective. But for me, nothing can beat the satisfaction of bearing witness to what lies beneath the earth.
