As for the animal sightings near the outskirts, this could likely be due to the encroachment of our activities into their natural habitats. I do mark known animal territories in the forest to avoid any unnecessary disturbances. However, I can investigate further which might necessitate some changes in where I chop the trees. If that's the case, we need to update the village map to reflect these changes, and also make sure everyone is aware and takes precautions when they need to venture into these areas.
