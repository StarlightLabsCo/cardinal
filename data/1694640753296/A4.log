[1694640855160] [35m[CORTEX] Lucy Wilde - Say: [39mAh, the Ancient Tree! Indeed, it’s a grand tale. It was the tallest and oldest tree in the forest, towering over its brothers and sisters. There was a kind of wisdom about it. You could sense it was old, probably older than this village. A true giant, whispering the lore of the years into the wind. We didn't just stumble upon it. It was as if the forest led us... yes, led us to it. George and I stood in awe, looking up into its thousand twinkling leaves, feeling small yet strangely connected. It was clear the tree had stories to tell, secrets from centuries past. Those moments are ones I hold deeply precious. They didn't just forge my bond with the forest, but with George as well.
