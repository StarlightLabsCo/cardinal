To him, it seems as though it hides a story within its boughs. He starts packing his bag for tomorrow - some food and water, a sketchbook for documenting the new things he'll discover, and his handmade whistle. He plans to make an early start at dawn, wave goodbye to Lucy and George, and dive headfirst into a new adventure.
[1694640835497] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Say: [39mLucy, did you remember the story about the Ancient Tree? I always get lost in the details. Do you mind telling it to me again? It's just so exciting!

It was the tallest and oldest tree in the forest, towering over its brothers and sisters. There was a kind of wisdom about it. You could sense it was old, probably older than this village. A true giant, whispering the lore of the years into the wind. We didn't just stumble upon it. It was as if the forest led us... yes, led us to it. George and I stood in awe, looking up into its thousand twinkling leaves, feeling small yet strangely connected. It was clear the tree had stories to tell, secrets from centuries past. Those moments are ones I hold deeply precious. They didn't just forge my bond with the forest, but with George as well.

[1694640875745] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Explain: [39mEli spent the day checking up on Lucy, catching up with her, and asking about her day. In their conversation, Eli was particularly interested in the story of the Ancient Tree. As Lucy recounted the tale, Eli found himself fully immersed in the narrative. The excitement and sense of wonder Lucy brought to the story further reinforced Eli's goal to understand and explore the forest.
