Afterward, he will proceed to the quiet hamlet he has heard stories about. There, he hopes to discover unique items and interesting stories which he can share with the people in the next town.

In the past, Harold hasn't shown much patience for my jokes, but looks like he's more open to them now. Seems like our recent conversations have started to thaw him slightly. I feel like I'm making some progress, but it's hard to tell with Harold. So, step by step, joke by joke, I'll keep working on our friendship.
