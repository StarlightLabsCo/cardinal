[1693116092065] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Explain: [39mI now understand that Thomas Smith initiated a conversation with me because of an urgent need. He needed my help to gather wood to make a splint for Lucy. This wasn't the adventure or tale I expected, but it has given me insight into his reason for reaching out. Even though it's far from an exploratory adventure, it's indeed a part of human connection and empathy, which is a very important aspect of life too.
