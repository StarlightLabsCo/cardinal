[1693120217750] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Explain: [39mIt seems like Thomas Smith approached me because he needed help with cutting a tree down for our campfire. Even though it conflicts with my love for nature, I understand that it is a necessary step for our survival. Further, Thomas assured that they would plant two trees for replacing the one we cut. This does help in assuaging my conflict to some extent. I've also come to recognize the importance of our inter-dependent relationship with nature, where we both give and take.
