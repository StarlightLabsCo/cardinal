[1695427185480] [35m[CORTEX] Thomas Smith - Plan: [39m Thomas Smith is planning to first greet Lucy Wilde warmly, feigning genuine interest in her life. He's going to inquire about her recent activities, subtly prying out any potentially useful information. Smith might also attempt to discuss some village matters, cleverly making it seem Lucy's thoughts and opinions are valuable, while actually steering the conversation to plant his thoughts into her mind. Finally, he would try to bring up Nume Falls and the campsite in the conversation, hoping to find any valuable intelligence that may help him control the village even more effectively.
[1695427188270] [35m[CORTEX] Thomas Smith - Say: [39mLucy, dear, how have you been? How are the greens growing in your garden? Still struggling with those pesky rabbits?

[1695427200392] [35m[CORTEX] Thomas Smith - Feel: [39mAh Thomas, your timing is impeccable. The greens are fighting for their lives against those rascally rabbits. Got any good solutions?
[1695427204973] [35m[CORTEX] Thomas Smith - Explain: [39mYes, indeed, Lucy! A good, old-fashioned scarecrow works well. Yet, if that fails, we could always ask around and see if there are other remedies in the village. Speaking of the village, have you seen any unusual things happen or heard any interesting rumors recently?
[1695427206257] [35m[CORTEX] Thomas Smith - Did I make progress? [39m[yes]
[1695427207340] [35m[CORTEX] Thomas Smith - Did I accomplish my goal? [39m[yes]
[1695427216012] [35m[CORTEX] Thomas Smith - Explain: [39mThomas knew he could easily end the conversation with Lucy now that he had subtly obtained some useful information. Yet, a part of him saw value in maintaining this connection. Lucy was well-liked in Nume Village, known for her kind nature and conversational skills. Keeping her on his side would undoubtedly serve his long-term interests. Thus, he decided to shift the goal of their conversation. Instead of merely seeking information, he now aimed to fortify his influence over Lucy, subtly planting the seeds of his ideas into her mind.
[1695427217096] [35m[CORTEX] Thomas Smith - Should I end the conversation? [39m[yes]
[1695427221323] [35m[CORTEX] Thomas Smith Goodbye: [39mLucy, it was a pleasure catching up with you. Do look after those vegetables and don't let those rabbits win the war. Until next time.
