[1693634219400] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Feel: [39mI feel excited to start a new conversation with Thomas Smith.
[1693634229417] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Plan: [39m Eli plans to continue exploring his favorite place, the forest near the village. His next adventure involves crafting a new whistle from a reed he recently found and attempting to use it to communicate with the birds. But before that, he wants to go to the tallest tree in the forest and try to get a better view of the village and the forest surrounding it as he feels there might still be hidden clearings that he hasnâ€™t discovered yet. He also wants to draw a map of the forest based on the view from the top. Eli is aware of the potential dangers, yet his spirit is undeterred, for he knows every journey unfurls a new story, a new poem that he canâ€™t wait to write.
