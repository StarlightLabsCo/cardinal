[1690320995263]Plan: 
[1690320995263]1. Using the axe in his inventory, Thomas is supposed to chop some wood as that is his first task as per the priority list.
2. He is already at the location with a tree with health 5/10, so there is no need for him to move.
3. He can swing the axe to chop some wood from the tree.

Reasoning:

Thomas doesn't need to move to another location nor does he require any other item from his inventory. By chopping the wood, he can proceed with his tasks as per the priority list.

[1690321026675]Plan: 
[1690321026675]Thomas Smith's first task is to chop wood. He is currently by a tree stump and is able to attack it with his axe. Once the tree stump's health has come down to 0, it will drop wood which Thomas can pick up. Given that his second task is to store wood in a chest, after collecting this wood, he should move towards the chest. 

However, after checking the environment, it's apparent that there are several trees in relatively close proximity that have higher health (10/10), and these trees could potentially give more wood upon being chopped, whereas the stump's health is only 5/5. It might be more efficient to go after chopping a tree instead of the stump, but this choice depends on how much wood each tree or stump yields when they are fully chopped down.

Since there isn't enough data available to decide which option yields more wood, we will go with the current available option of chopping the tree stump.

Given the available information, pick the best available action to accomplish your tasks. Respond in JSON: { type: [ActionType], data: {characterId optional parameters}}. Please note that if an action is in the available items list, you can execute it immediately, without needing to change or move. First you should list your reasoning and create a plan, and then using that plan, select an action and create a JSON object for that action with the necessary info. The JSON object must be immediately after "Action: " as we're using regex to parse it.
