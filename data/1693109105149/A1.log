[1693109387255] [35m[CORTEX] Thomas Smith - Prior Message: [39mThomas, did I ever tell you about the secret clearing I found in the woods? It's a magical place where the sunbeams filter through the leaves and create a beautiful dance of light. I go there when I need to think, rest, or just be in the quiet with the forest. It's my personal hideout. You should find one too, Thomas. There's something about having a place that's just your own in the midst of all this grand wilderness. It's comforting, yet thrilling at the same time.
