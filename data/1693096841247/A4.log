[1693096957224] [35m[CORTEX] Lucy Wilde - Plan: [39m Lucy plans to continue her work in the forest, honing her skills and taking great care to respect the forest's equilibrium. She's looking forward to more conversations by the campfire with George and hopes to teach young Will more about responsible forestry. She also plans to make sure the village's timber needs are met while ensuring the forest's sustainability and health.
[1693096961058] [35m[CORTEX] Lucy Wilde - Say: [39mRespecting the forest is essential to our way of life. We take what we need, no more and give back twice as much. It's a balance that we must maintain for future generations.
