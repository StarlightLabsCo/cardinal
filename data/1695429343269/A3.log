[1695429447387] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Prior Message: [39mWill, when you chop wood, try the trees at 49.14, -34.84 or 52.87, -37.29. They sit far from our village, assuring peace in our day. Remember, a sharp blow diagonal to the grain cuts fastest. Afterward, soak your weariness at the waterfall on 35, -10. It's a blissful hideaway. Lastly, our enemies set up base at 50, 60. Stay alert for their strike.

[1695429451470] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Feel: [39mI feel excited and a tad nervous about Eleanor's advice. The potential dangers seem to add a certain thrill to my journey, but the peaceful nooks she points out combat that with a reassuring calmness.
[1695429458765] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Plan: [39m I plan to remember Eleanor's advice about the locations suitable for chopping wood. Initially, I'll aim for a diagonal cut for a quick result as she suggested. After a potentially tiring day, heading to the waterfall on 35, -10 to rejuvenate sounds ideal. Lastly, keeping a watchful eye for a potential enemy strike at 50, 60 will become a part of my routine. My journey as an apprentice miner continues as I learn and grow.
[1695429464339] [35m[CORTEX] Will Turner - Say: [39mThanks for the tips, Eleanor. I'll chop wood at the places you suggested and be sure to cut diagonal to the grain. That waterfall does sound like the perfect place to unwind after a hard day's work. I'll be careful and stay alert for any enemies at those coordinates. Onwards to becoming a better miner!
