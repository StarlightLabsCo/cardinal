[1695429439486] [35m[CORTEX] Eleanor Wraithwind - Plan: [39m First, I'll recommend the trees at coordinates X: 49.14, Y: -34.84 or X: 52.87, Y: -37.29 for Will to chop. They're distant from our village, minimizing the disturbance to our daily life. Next, I'll share some tips from my family's hunting experiences to help him improve his wood chopping efficiency. Afterwards, I'll introduce him to the waterfall at 35, -10 as a place for rest after his hard work. Finally, I'll update him on the defence situation, especially the enemies' base at 50, 60 that I've scouted, preparing him for any possible attacks.
[1695429447382] [35m[CORTEX] Eleanor Wraithwind - Say: [39mWill, when you chop wood, try the trees at 49.14, -34.84 or 52.87, -37.29. They sit far from our village, assuring peace in our day. Remember, a sharp blow diagonal to the grain cuts fastest. Afterward, soak your weariness at the waterfall on 35, -10. It's a blissful hideaway. Lastly, our enemies set up base at 50, 60. Stay alert for their strike.

[1695429464339] [35m[CORTEX] Eleanor Wraithwind - Prior Message: [39mThanks for the tips, Eleanor. I'll chop wood at the places you suggested and be sure to cut diagonal to the grain. That waterfall does sound like the perfect place to unwind after a hard day's work. I'll be careful and stay alert for any enemies at those coordinates. Onwards to becoming a better miner!
