[1693179973408] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Plan: [39m Tomorrow, I plan on waking up early to explore a new part of the forest I've never been to before. I've heard from George about a hidden waterfall that I want to discover. I also plan to try out my new reed whistle to see if I can communicate with any animals. By the end of the day, I aim to mark out a new trail on my map, adding to the expanse of my explored world.
