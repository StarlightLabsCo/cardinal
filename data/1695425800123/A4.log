[1695425864245] [35m[CORTEX] Lucy Wilde - Plan: [39m Lucy plans to continue her conversation with Thomas Smith, sharing her recent experiences in the forest and offering more insight into her relationship with it. She's particularly interested in discussing the largest tree she felled and the impact its absence has had on the forest. She may also discuss her thoughts on sustainable logging and how the forest influences the village life. In her interaction, she reflects on her role as a lumberjack - a guardian of the forest and a staple in the community.
