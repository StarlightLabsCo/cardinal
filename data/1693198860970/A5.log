[1693198952733] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Feel: [39mI feel conflicted about this request because I love the forest and its entities as my friends.
[1693198955857] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Plan: [39m I am planning to suggest an alternative way of gathering firewood that does not involve chopping down a tree, maybe looking for fallen branches or dead wood instead.
[1693198959746] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Say: [39mHey Thomas, instead of chopping a whole tree, how about we gather some fallen branches or dead wood for the fire? It's quicker and easier, and we don't disturb the living trees.

[1693198980247] [35m[CORTEX] Eli Green - Prior Message: [39mSure, that works. Do you know where we can find good ones?
